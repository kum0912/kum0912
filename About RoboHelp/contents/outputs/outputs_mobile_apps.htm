  <h1>Mobile App Output</h1>
  <p>You can also create the content of your project as an app for Apple and Android devices. This can be useful in many scenarios where the user requires information but may not have guaranteed online access. Medical staff having to work in remote locations without internet access would be an example.</p>
  <p>Be aware that PhoneGap, which was used to generate Mobile Apps, was closed on 1 October 2020. See this <a href="https://blog.phonegap.com/update-for-customers-using-phonegap-and-phonegap-build-cc701c77502c" target="_blank" title="Phone Gap Blog">PhoneGap Blog</a></p>
  <p>It is no longer possible to produce a mobile app using the old workflow. New presets will have to be created with different fields reflecting the new way that mobile apps need to be generated. It is likely that you will need developer assistance as it is a far more complex procedure.</p>

How this is set up is described in <a href="publishing.htm">Publishing</a>.</p>
