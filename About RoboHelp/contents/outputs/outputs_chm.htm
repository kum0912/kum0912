  <h1>Microsoft HTML Output - CHM</h1>
  <p>Notwithstanding its age, this format refuses to die. It is still popular where the help has to accessible offline and contained in a single file.</p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" style="border: none;" /> CHM files do not understand CSS3 standards so a copy of the css used is converted to CSS2 on the fly. This may mean the output is not exactly as designed.</p>
  <h2>Creating a CHM</h2>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_top_and bottom" src="../assets/images/outputs/chm01.png" /></p>
  <div data-conref="../assets/snippets/Path.hts"> </div>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" style="border: none;" /> Whilst you can create a Publish Location for this output, CHM files cannot be run from a server and this option should not be used for that purpose. Typically it will be used to deliver it to developers. How this is set up is described in <a href="publishing.htm">Publishing</a>.</p>
  <h2>Windows</h2>
  <p>To create or edit the window for Microsoft HTML Help (CHMs), click Outputs and select Window Settings.</p>
  <p>Existing windows will be listed and you can create new ones by clicking the + icon.</p>
  <p>Double click a window shown in the Project Component Panel to edit it or hover over it and click the menu icon that will be displayed.</p>
  <p>You will then see the various settings that can be applied. Please refer to the <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> online help for details.</p>
  <p><img src="../assets/images/outputs/windows01.png" /></p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" style="border: none;" /> If you also create other help outputs and your developers use an API with a window defined, settings for other outputs will be added later</p>
  <h2>Section (Book) and Topic Icons</h2>
  <p>By default all sections will have a book icon and all topics will have a page icon. In <a href="../authoring/project_settings.htm">Project Settings</a> you can enable Advanced HTML Help Options, then in the <a href="../toc_index_glossary/toc.htm">TOC</a> you can define section and topic specific icons.</p>
