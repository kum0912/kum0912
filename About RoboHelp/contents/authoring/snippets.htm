  <h1>Snippets</h1>
  <h2>Content Reuse for Images, Tables, Text and More</h2>
  <p>Snippets can contain text, variables, images and suchlike. They are especially useful where you need to repeat the same content in many topics as any change only has to be made once.</p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" style="border: none;" /> You can add a snippet within a snippet and you can add a snippet inline.</p>
  <h2>Creating Snippets</h2>
  <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li>Click the Snippet icon in the project toolbar on the left and any snippets already created will display alongside in the Snippet Panel or select some text, right click and select Create Snippet</li>
    <li>Hover over a snippet and click the Options icon to edit, delete or see the properties of a snippet.<br />
      <img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_top_only" src="../assets/images/authoring/snippets02.png" />
    </li>
    <li>Click the + icon to add a snippet<br />
      <br />
      <img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_bottom_only" src="../assets/images/authoring/snippets01.png" style="cursor: nwse-resize;" />
    </li>
    <li>When you click Add, the New Snippet dialog displays.<br />
      <img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_top_only" src="../assets/images/authoring/snippets03.png" />
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="emphasis1" style="margin-left: 18pt;"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" style="border: none;" /> In Classic versions of <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> no CSS is applied to a snippet, it takes on the CSS of the topic in which it is used. In <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> the default css set in Project Settings is applied. If you want Snippets to work the old way, when you create a Snippet go to Topic Properties and remove the link to the CSS.<br />
    It is important that you remove the link to your default css if you will be using the snippet inline, unless it is the same css as used in the topic.</p>
  <ol start="5" style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li>Set the fields as required and click Create to open a blank Snippet in the Design Editor.</li>
    <li>Set up the snippet as required. <span style="text-indent: -24px;">If you want to apply a specific CSS to the snippet rather than allowing it to inherit the CSS of the topics it is used in, right click and select Topic Properties.</span></li>
    <li> Save your changes.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" style="border: none;" /> You can also select text in a topic, right click and select Snippet &gt; Create to set up a new snippet from existing content.</p>
  <h2>Adding Snippets to a Topic</h2>
  <p>You can either drag a snippet from the Snippet Panel or press CTRL 2 and double click there.</p>
  <p>You can insert the snippet within a paragraph or you can use it as a block snippet by inserting it in a new line.</p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNote.png" style="cursor: nesw-resize;" /> Snippets that contain block elements such as a table, cannot be used inline. They will get added as a block snippet.</p>
  <h2>Snippet Properties</h2>
  <p>While you are working on the Snippet, you will see the Properties panel alongside allowing you to modify the appearance.</p>
  <h2>Snippet Folders</h2>
  <p>When you create a Snippet it is automatically saved in Assets &gt; Snippets. View that folder in the Contents Panel and you can then create folders and organize your snippets as you wish. The Snippets Panel is a flat view of all Snippets in the project, no matter where they are saved.</p>
  <h2>Snippets or Variables</h2>
  <p>In previous versions of <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> snippets could only be added as a paragraph. That meant where you wanted to repeatedly add the same string inline, you had to create a variable and use that. Now using an inlne snippet would be the correct solution. Variables are now for where you want to use different values in different outputs such as $ and £ signs and values.</p>
