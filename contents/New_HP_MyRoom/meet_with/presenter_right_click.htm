          <p>Your private chat window opens. This is a regular chat window. You can chat with this person as long as you want, drag others from the main event or your Contacts list into the chat, eject anyone from the chat. Closing the main event does not close this chat room. You can have multiple private chats in an event.  </p>

            <li style="margin-left: -20px;">Additional users who are brought into a private chat only see the history from the time they entered the chat. They do not see what was chatted previously.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: -20px;">There is no content, no audio, no video and no recording capability in a private chat.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: -20px;">Everyone in a private chat can share desktops or regions of desktops. Whatever is shared in the private chat is not seen by others in the main room, only those in the chat so you can privately discuss and show something to one person without the entire room seeing what is being shared.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: -20px;">Presenters and Hosts can turn off the Private Chat function for Participants using Configure room for participants in the Tools to manage people and room features option of the People panel. If disabled, Presenters and Hosts can still private chat with the Participants but Participants cannot start a Private Chat themselves.</li>

          <p>There are times when you do not want to be disturbed by a private chat in a room, for instance, if you are sharing your desktop and want to make sure no one disturbs your presentation. Right click in the People panel and choose Block Private Chat from the menu. This removes the Private Chat option above from the menu when others in the room right click on your name.</p>

It is saved as a .txt file with minimal formatting that can be opened with a text editor. The history, including the chat view entries, is saved as a TXT file to minimize file size and therefore the time to load it into the room.   </p>
