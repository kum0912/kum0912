  <h1>Configure room for participants</h1>
  <p>Changes made to the Configure room for participants option are persistent. As a presenter, you should check before your event to make sure you have allocated the features you want for your participants.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>You will see all the choices available in this menu if you have purchased MyRoom University. If you have the MyRoom Assist option along with MyRoom Premium or MyRoom University, you will see the Copy Clipboard, Get remote system information, Remote control, Tables and optionally, the Waiting room, options. Waiting room is only available in the MyRoom Assist option. Please go to the MyRoom <a href="/features" title="MyRoom features">Features</a> page for a complete description of the features available in each option.</p>
