  <h1>Move to room</h1>
  <p>As a presenter, you can choose to move a participant in an event into one of the rooms in your Rooms list, including rooms in which you have a role. When you move someone into another room, they are removed from the room and placed into the other room. You stay in the current room but you are also placed in the other room.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>You will see all the choices available in this menu if you have purchased MyRoom University. If you have the MyRoom Assist option along with MyRoom Premium or MyRoom University, you will see the Copy Clipboard, Get remote system information, Remote control, Tables and optionally, the Waiting room, options. Waiting room is only available in the MyRoom Assist option. Please go to the MyRoom <a href="/features" title="MyRoom features">Features</a> page for a complete description of the features available in each option.</p>
