    <h1>Disciplinary Procedures</h1>
    <p class="EmphasisSlate">These procedures are designed to help and encourage all employees to achieve and maintain standards of conduct, attendance and job performance. The procedures apply to all employees. The aim is to ensure consistent and fair treatment for all in the
      company.</p>

        <li>For formal action the employee will be advised of the nature of the complaint against him or her and will be given the opportunity to state his or her case before any decision is made at a disciplinary meeting.

                  <p>Minor breaches of discipline, misconduct, poor time-keeping and so on may result in an informal oral warning given by the employee’s immediate manager.</p>

                      <p>It is expected that in most cases an informal oral warning will resolve most difficulties. Where an employee commits a more serious act of misconduct or fails to improve and maintain that improvement with regard to conduct, behavior

                        A union official means a full-time official or a lay official certified by the union as having experience of, or having been trained in, acting as a companion at disciplinary hearings. It should be noted that neither spouse/partner
