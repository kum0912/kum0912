  <p>The New Contact - General screen is viewed by editing an Account, clicking the Contacts tab and clicking the New Contact button in the lower right corner of the dialog. This view provides the ability to enter all information related to the Contact that
    is being added. Most fields are easily identified and therefore no help is provided for them. However, there are a few areas that may require explanation.</p>
  <p>There is an area that allows an image to be added. It is intended to be the image of the contact. If you have the image stored on your operating system as a file, you may drag it from the operating system to the image area to insert and add it to the
    database. If you are visiting a client location, you may ask the client to sit in front of a camera connected to the PC and the image may be obtained that way as well.</p>
