  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">About the leisure travel market</span></h1>
  <p><span data-keyref="CompanyName">Compass Travel</span> began to notice that a substantial number of its customers were asking about making travel arrangements for destinations that weren’t in the normal business realm. Additionally, employees noticed
    an increasing number of questions about whether <span data-keyref="CompanyName">Compass Travel</span> offered “anything that children might enjoy”. So we embarked on a process to discover whether we should consider offering specialized services to
    clients. Thus, the Leisure Travel division was created to focus on these new business opportunities.</p>
