  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">About corporate travel</span></h1>
  <p>Travel is typically broken into two rather broad areas. These areas are known as leisure and corporate. Most folks are familiar with leisure travel and are typically oblivious to the fact that corporate travel exists. They never really give any thought
    to the fact that a lot of travel falls into the corporate category.</p>
  <p>Some of the larger companies will have a dedicated Corporate Travel department that is staffed with employees that make the travel arrangements for the companyâ€™s employees. Many companies need to make corporate travel arrangements but simply cannot
    justify maintaining a full time staff to support this role.</p>
  <p>While corporate travel can take you anywhere the business needs to go, most often it occurs when needing to visit large cities such as San Francisco, CA, Denver, CO, Toronto, CAN and New York City.</p>
