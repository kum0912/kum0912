  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">About the corporate travel market</span></h1>
  <p><span data-keyref="CompanyName">Compass Travel</span> began to notice that a substantial number of its customers were making travel arrangements for destinations that weren’t suited for leisure. Additionally, employees noticed an increasing number of
    questions about whether <span data-keyref="CompanyName">Compass Travel</span> offered a “business discount”. So we embarked on a process to discover whether we should consider offering specialized services to businesses. Thus, the Corporate Travel
    division was created to focus on these new business opportunities.</p>
