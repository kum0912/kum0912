<h2><a id="Approach_A"></a>Approach A:  Classes are created using 
 the ASSIGNED CLASSES feature in homerooms </h2>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Elementary schools typically have all students 
 in a homeroom taking all or the majority of  the classes at the same 
 time with the same teacher. Each homeroom can have a list of assigned 
 classes (e.g. the students in that homeroom can be automatically assigned 
 to the classes when the student is placed in that homeroom). If a homeroom 
 has multiple grade levels, each grade can have a distinct list of classes 
 (e.g. a grade 2/3 homeroom can have a list of classes for the grade 2 
 students and a list of classes for the grade 3 students). If student changes 
 homerooms during the school year, where report card information is the 
 same between homerooms, the report card information can optionally be 
 transferred with the student so that any new teachers will have access 
 to the information recorded by the previous teachers.  Approach A 
 uses the functionality found when editing a homeroom, and selecting the 
 <a href="../setup/setup-class-hmrm.htm#Assigned_classes">ASSIGNED CLASSES</a> 
 tab. </p>
<h3>A1. Prepare for next year</h3>
<p>The scheduling process beings with running the ‘initialize next year’ 
 process.  This process duplicates the school information from this 
 year, into the next year.  This makes re-entering last year&#39;s homerooms, 
 advisor groups, courses, classes, and semester/term/day/period information 
 unnecessary if they will be similar for the next year.  It also advances 
 the students’ next year grades.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/elemoverview1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:432px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Run the<a href="sched-initialize-scheduling.htm"> initialize next year</a> 
 option.  We suggest that you use the option &quot;Set students&#39; next 
 year homerooms to not assigned&quot; so that no timetables are automatically 
 assigned to students until their homerooms are assigned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/elemoverview_6.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:618px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Update the <a href="../setup/setup-class-sem-term-day-pd.htm">semester/term/day/period</a> 
 info if needed.</p>
<h3>A2. Remove all elementary level classes</h3>
<p>Classes from the previous school year are automatically copied over 
 to the next year&#39;s classes.  Since these classes will be all recreated 
 for the new school year, last year&#39;s elementary classes need to be removed. 
 </p>
<h3>A3. Set up homerooms and their assigned classes</h3>
<p>i. The homeroom should be adjusted to match next year&#39;s needs using 
 <a href="../setup/setup-class-hmrm.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Homerooms 
 &gt; Homerooms</a>. This may include:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Adding new homerooms</li>
	<li>Removing homerooms no longer needed</li>
	<li>Editing homerooom teacher(s)</li>
	<li>Editing room and designation info</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>ii. Edit each homeroom and use the <a href="../setup/setup-class-hmrm.htm#Assigned_classes">ASSIGNED 
 CLASSES</a> tab to create all the classes that the students in this homeroom 
 will need. Here is an example of a homeroom with the assigned classes 
 defined. When a student in grade 5 next year is assigned to homeroom 5 
 - 114, their timetable will automatically get DRA5a, ENG5a, etc. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/elemoverview7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1430px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A4. Assign students to homerooms</h3>
<p>Once the homerooms are set up correctly, the students should be assigned 
 into their next year&#39;s homerooms. There are many different options to 
 assist in assigning the student&#39;s next year&#39;s homerooms using Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Homerooms. These options are more convenient than editing 
 each student, one at a time, and there should be one method that works 
 well for your school.  Descriptions of each option is provided on 
 the card.</p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homeroomsgd.htm">By grade</a> </p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-pd.htm">By period</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-class.htm">By class</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-hmrm.htm">By homeroom</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-random.htm">By random group</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-ind-gd.htm">Individual by grade</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-ind-hmrm.htm">Individual by homeroom</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If printed lists of the students in a homeroom are needed, use the <a href="../students/stu-reports-clist-hmrm.htm">Homeroom lists</a> card 
 to generate those reports. Once the students are assigned into homeroom, 
 they will have the auto-assign classes added to their next year timetables.</p>
<h3><img src="assets/images/elemoverview3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1407px;" border="0"/></h3>
<h3>A5. Define class schedule</h3>
<p>Step 3 would have created classes that are accessible using <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Classes</a>. The actual schedule (when the 
 class is taught) was not defined in step 3 so it should be defined now. 
 Often the actual schedule of when the subjects are taught is not formally 
 recorded in the SIS, allowing the teachers to teach subjects based on 
 their own schedules.  Sometimes, classes are formally scheduled to 
 avoid teacher and room conflicts (e.g. physical education, French, music). 
 When classes are formally scheduled, the schedule is determined manually 
 by the school and then it is entered into the SIS.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Classes not formally scheduled into periods may be assigned a <a href="../setup/setup-class-sem-term-day-pd.htm#Unique_class_schedules">floater 
	 pattern</a> (a user-defined day/period pattern that has no periods 
	 selected). A semester/term pattern must be assigned (typically something 
	 representing full year).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Classes scheduled into periods may be assigned to semester/term/day/period 
	 patterns (e.g. full year, period 1) but often the schedule is random 
	 and creating unique patterns would be time-consuming.  In the 
	 set up of the class, it may be flagged as requiring a <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm#Special_schedule">special 
	 schedule</a> which then allows the user to select the specific semesters/terms 
	 and days/periods unique to that class.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If new rooms are added to the school next year, or rooms are no longer 
 available, adjust the table of rooms using <a href="../setup/setup-class-rm-printrm-tt.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Rooms</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the classes are set up, see an overall view of the teacher and 
 room timetables using the  <a href="sched-teacher-master-timetable.htm">Teacher 
 master timetable</a> and <a href="sched-room-master-timetable.htm">Room 
 master timetable</a> cards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/elemoverview2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:862px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A6. Assign other classes to students</h3>
<p>With the &#39;assigned classes&#39; feature set up for homerooms (as described 
 above), students will already have classes in their timetables based on 
 their homerooms. If the students take additional classes (e.g. if the 
 homeroom students break out into different classes for rotary subjects), 
  or if the &#39;assigned classes&#39; feature is not used, these class assignment 
 tools may assist:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><a href="../students/assign-timetables-addclass.htm">Add classes</a></li>
	<li><a href="../students/assign-timetables-delclass.htm">Delete classes</a></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/elemoverview4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:646px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note: clear timetables is not recommended because it will clear out 
 the auto-assigned classes and they will not be re-added unless the student&#39;s 
 homerooms were to be changed.</p>
<h4>A7. Advisor groups </h4>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">If advisor groups are used, they should be 
 adjusted to match next year&#39;s needs using <a href="../setup/setup-class-advisors.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Advisor groups &gt; Advisor groups</a>. Advisor groups 
 are similar to homerooms where a room and teacher(s) is/are assigned to 
 the advisor group. The name of the group can be anything the school wants. 
 Some schools use advisor groups to indicate the guidance councilor assigned 
 to the student. Some schools have students meet regularly in groups where 
 the students meet with an advisory teacher to discuss general school related 
 topics.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">If advisor groups change from year to year, 
 there are many different options to assist in assigning the student&#39;s 
 next year&#39;s advisor groups. These options are more convenient than editing 
 each student, one at a time, and there should be one method that works 
 well for your school.  Descriptions of each option is provided on 
 the card.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p><a href="../students/advisor-group-by-grade.htm">By grade</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/advisor-group-by-class.htm">By class</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/advisor-group-by-advisor-group.htm">By advisor 
 group</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/advisor-group-ind-by-grade.htm">Individual by grade</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/advisor-group-ind-by-homeroom.htm">Individual by 
 homeroom</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If printed lists of the students in a advisor group needed, use the 
 <a href="../students/stu-reports-clist-advisor.htm">Advisor group lists</a> 
 card to generate those reports.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img src="assets/images/elemoverview5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1393px;" border="0"/></p>
<h4>A8. Print timetables</h4>
<p>Printing timetables for <a href="../students/stu-reports-tt-stu-tt.htm">students</a>, 
 <a href="sched-print-teacher-tt.htm">teachers</a>, <a href="sched-print-room-timetable.htm">rooms</a> 
 is often not necessary in elementary schools, but the option is available 
 if needed. <a href="../students/stu-reports-clist-class.htm">Class lists</a> 
 are also available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/elemoverview8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:860px;" border="0"/></p>
<h3>A9. Year-end roll over</h3>
<p>The board/division/district is responsible for the actual <a href="Transfer_to_current.htm">Transfer 
 to current</a> process, however schools should make sure that they have 
 run the <a href="Archive_attendance___achievement.htm">Archive attendance 
 &amp; achievement process</a>. This process may be done at any time during 
 the scheduling process, as long as it is run after the current school 
 year is done and no further attendance or report card data is being entered. 
  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/elemoverview9.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:219px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Typically the roll over is done over the summer, before the students 
 start school again in the fall. It cannot be run before the current school 
 year is finished (e.g. it cannot be done in June), nor can it be run when 
 the school still needs the current year&#39;s info for reporting and other 
 processes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The transfer to current process takes all the &#39;next year&#39; info and copies 
 it into &#39;this year&#39;. This info includes:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>courses</li>
	<li>classes</li>
	<li>rooms</li>
	<li>timetables</li>
	<li>students&#39; grades, homerooms and advisor groups</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Student who are no longer returning to the school become past students, 
 and all other students are assigned the school year status of &#39;this year 
 and next year&#39;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Once the school has transferred to current, 
 there should be no further use of the Scheduling next year options.  All 
 changes to data need to be done to the &#39;this year&#39; info.</p>
