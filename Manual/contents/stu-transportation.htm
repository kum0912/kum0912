  <h1>Student records &gt;  Student records &gt; Transportation</h1>
  <hr align="center" style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" />
  <p>The transportation option provides a way to record detailed information about how a student gets to and from school. The list of possible ways that a student gets to and from school is defined by the board/division/district (<a href="../setup/setup-transp-types.htm">Setup &gt; Transportation &gt; Types</a>) and may include methods such as walk, taxi, public transport, and bus.   Each transportation type is flagged as to whether bus info is needed), and if bus info is needed, the student may have up to 2 inbound buses, 2 outbound buses, and a late bus (if available to the students involved in after school activities).  Before entering bus info in the student&#39;s record, each school will have their own list of buses that must be set up (Setup &gt; Transportation &gt;<a href="../setup/setup-transp-in.htm"> Inbound</a> and <a href="../setup/setup-transp-out.htm">Outbound</a>). The board/division/district will also defined a list of <a href="../setup/setup-transp-reasons.htm">Reasons</a> that may be specified for each student to describe why they have the selected transportation type (e.g. lives outside walk limit, or lives inside walk limit).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If the student has the same inbound and outbound info, many schools only record the inbound info.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If a student has unique pickup or drop off addresses, this information is recorded as part of the student&#39;s address information as recorded in the <a href="stu-personal-contact-info.htm">Personal &gt; Contact info</a> area of the student&#39;s record.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Transportation info may be recorded for the current school year only, and therefore this option does not apply to past students. Transportation info is specific to the school, so students enrolled in multiple schools may have info recorded at each school. Integration with transportation planning applications may be available to automatically update the student&#39;s bus info.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The Transportation option is available from the student&#39;s record.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/stu-rep35.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 624px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The student&#39;s transportation will appear, if previously entered. If no transportation info exists, use the Edit icon on the transportation card. Inbound and Outbound cards will appear if applicable to the student.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/stu-transp3.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 711px;" /></p>
  <p>Use the Edit icon on any of the cards to access the transportation info which uses a tab navigation to move between GENERAL, INBOUND and OUTBOUND information. In and outbound tabs appear only if the student&#39;s in via and out via field values require bus info.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Note: When first entering in via and out via fields for the student, the SAVE button must be selected to save the data and then the INBOUND and OUTBOUND tabs will appear, if needed.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">As you navigate between the tabs, the info on each tab will be automatically saved. The SAVE button is disabled if there is no info to save, so select the CANCEL button to leave the form.</span></p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/stu-transp2.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 1005px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>GENERAL tab</h3>
  <p>The GENERAL tab contains the following fields:<br />
    <br />
    <span style="color: #007fff;">In via:</span> Select from the values in the transportation types table to describe how the student gets to school (e.g. walk, bus).  If this value is setup needed bus info, then the INBOUND tab will appear upon selecting SAVE.
  </p>
  <p><span style="color: #007fff;">Out via:</span> Select from the values in the transportation types table to describe how the student leaves school (e.g. walk, bus).  If this value is setup needed bus info, then the OUTBOUND tab will appear upon selecting SAVE.</p>
  <p><span style="color: #007fff;">Reason:</span> Select from the values in the reasons table (typically to describe why the student has the selected types).</p>
  <p><span style="color: #007fff;">Comment:</span> An optional note may be entered to comment on the student&#39;s transportation to/from school.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>INBOUND tab</h3>
  <p>The INBOUND tab contains info about the student&#39;s bus to school. The student may have up to 2 bus routes recorded here.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/stu-transp4.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 1010px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The following field are available on the INBOUND tab:</p>
  <p><span style="color: #007fff;">Bus 1 Route/bus</span>: Select the student&#39;s first bus the student takes to get to school. Select from the values in the inbound bus table. The route name, number and operator are shown to help select the correct bus.</p>
  <p><span style="color: #007fff;">Bus 1 Stop</span>: Optionally select the stop from the values in the inbound bus table. The stop name, location, type and time are shown to help select the correct stop.</p>
  <p><span style="color: #007fff;">Bus 2 Route/bus</span>: If applicable, select the student&#39;s second bus taken to get to school.</p>
  <p><span style="color: #007fff;">Bus 2 Stop</span>: If applicable, select the student&#39;s stop for the second bus to school.</p>
  <p><span style="color: #007fff;">Comment</span>: An optional note may be entered to comment on the student&#39;s transportation to school.</p>
  <p><span style="color: #007fff;">Last modified</span>: The date this info was last updated.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>OUTBOUND tab</h3>
  <p>The OUTBOUND tab contains info about the student&#39;s bus home from school at the end of the day. The student may have up to 3 buses recorded here (bus 1, bus 2, and a late bus).</p>
  <p>This tab appears if the student&#39;s out via transportation type was set up indicating that it needs bus info.  This tab is similar to the inbound tab, except that it uses the outbound table of buses, and it includes the option for a late bus. The &#39;late bus&#39; is the equivalent to a 3rd bus for the student, using the same list of outbound buses and stops. The outbound comment is another comment designed for a note on the student&#39;s transportation from school at the end of the day. The last modified date is a different date specifically for the date the student&#39;s outbound info was last updated.</p>
