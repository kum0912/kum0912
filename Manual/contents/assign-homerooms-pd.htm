  <h1>Student tools &gt; Homerooms &gt; By period</h1>
  <h1>Scheduling next year &gt; Homerooms &gt; By period</h1>
  <hr align="center" style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" />
  <p class="Style1">This tool provides a quick way to assign homerooms to all students based on the student’s location in a specific period. For example, if at the start of period 1, the teacher has some time devoted for homeroom tasks or school announcements, then homerooms may be assigned based on the students’ period 1 classes.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A student has a homeroom for the current school year and the forthcoming school year, where applicable. Therefore, this tool is available for assigning this year’s or next year’s homerooms.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The tool will need to know exactly which class to use from the student’s timetable. Therefore, the semester, term, day and period must be indicated if the school has more than 1 semester, term, or day.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Prior to running this tool, it is first important to make sure that the school’s homerooms  are setup correctly. Using the period 1 example, if a period 1 class is taught in room 101, there must be a corresponding homeroom assigned to room 101. The tool, will use the room number of the student’s class to determine which homeroom they are to be assigned. <a href="../setup/setup-class-hmrm.htm">See Homeroom setup</a> for detailed information, including the impact of the homeroom’s semester/term fields which must also be accurately set.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When a student’s current year’s homeroom is changed, a dated record of the change is stored in the student’s internal transfers. Internal transfers are accessible from the Internal transfers option within the Enrolment area of the student’s record. Along with the date of the change, it records the student’s original homeroom and their new homeroom.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>From the main menu choose Student tools &gt; Homerooms.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Select THIS YEAR or NEXT YEAR on the By period card, depending on whether homerooms are to be assigned to this year’s or next year’s homerooms.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-hmrm6.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 236px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The Homeroom - By period screen will appear:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-hmrm7.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 635px;" /></p>
  <p>First, select the semester, term, day, and period to define exactly which class will be used. An information tool tip is available to remind you how these fields are used: “Homeroom to be assigned will match the room number assigned to the class in the student’s timetable based on the  period info provided here”.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Next, select a homeroom to be assigned to those students with a spare (no class exists in the student’s timetable). An information tool tip is available to remind you how this field is used: “This homeroom will be assigned to students who have no class in the selected period. It is also used when a student has a class, but no homeroom is setup for that class room number for that semester/term.”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Once the class and homeroom are selected, select the ASSIGN button at the bottom of the page. Once the process is complete, the students in that class will be assigned the new homeroom.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-hmrm222.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:538px;" /></p>
  <p>Depending upon your school’s report card setup, sometimes report card information is tied to the student’s homeroom. This information may include marks (such as overall student learning skills), comments (such as an overall comment on the student), and programs (such as IEP, ESL). If the report card information cannot be transferred because the original and the new homerooms are not setup the same way, a message will appear.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-hmrm8.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 314px;" /></p>
  <p>We would suggest you view the list of students, unless you know that teachers have not yet begun report card entries. If you examine the report card information for the students, you will be able to see the information for both the old (deleted) homeroom and the current homeroom. If required, transfer tools are available.</p>
  <h3>Homeroom setup</h3>
  <p>Prior to running this tool, it is first important to make sure that the school’s <a href="../setup/setup-class-hmrm.htm">homerooms are setup</a> correctly. Using the period 1 example, if a period 1 class is taught in room 101, there must be a corresponding homeroom assigned to room 101. The tool, will use the room number of the student’s class to determine which homeroom they are to be assigned.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The homeroom setup includes the ability to indicate which semester(s)/term(s) apply to each homeroom. If students are assigned the same homeroom for the entire school year, all homerooms will have all semester/term check boxes checked off to indicate that the homeroom is available/used for the entire year.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This homeroom assignment tool will use these semester/term settings in the homeroom table to indicate whether the homeroom is available (applicable) for the selected semester and term.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For example, if homerooms are based on a student’s period 1 class, the students’ homerooms will change with each new semester (or possibly term). Using the semester/term fields, a school may have a homeroom 10A in room 101 with Ms. Smith in semester 1, and a different homeroom, 11C in room 101 with Mr. Johnson in semester 2. Room 103 may be used by Mr. Blackwell for both semesters. If Mr. Blackwell has different classes in each semester, the students assigned to that homeroom will change with the new semester. If the homeroom designation doesn’t need to change between semesters, the homeroom 103 is set to both semesters. If the homeroom designation is different between semesters, the homeroom 103 appears as 2 separate entries.</p>
