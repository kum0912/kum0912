  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This option is only available to Ontario secondary schools.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In addition to the compulsory credits, Ontario students must complete a minimum of 40 hours of community involvement activities to obtain the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD). The community involvement requirement is designed to provide students with the opportunity to develop awareness and understanding about civic responsibility. They can actively participate in supporting and strengthening their communities and it provides the opportunity for students to learn more about themselves and possible career opportunities. Students can start accumulating hours in the summer before entering Grade 9.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The Community involvement option in the student&#39;s record allows schools to track the student&#39;s community involvement activities including the number of hours and minutes that may be counted toward the 40 required hours.  It provides a running total of all activities recorded here. Once the student reaches 40 hours, they are automatically flagged as having completed this requirement. The Ontario provincial report cards for secondary students includes the student&#39;s community involvement hours, so we do recommend that this information is updated regularly as the information is provided to the school. If the school does not track the activities here, they must manually flag the student as having completed this requirement since this is also used in reporting to OnSIS and OCAS/OUAC.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/cominvolv.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Accumulated community involvement hours and minutes are also displayed in the student&#39;s record using the Achievement &gt; <a href="achievement-grad-reqmts.htm">Graduation requirements</a> option. From this other location, a quick link is available to access the detailed info found on this page.</p>
  <p><img src="assets/images/cominvolvgradreq.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Community involvement data is student-based so that the information is accessible to all schools with access to the student&#39;s record. Only the school that is the edsembli record owner may edit this information.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>To access the student&#39;s community involvement, choose the Community involvement option from the Achievement sub menu.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  <h3>Community involvement</h3>
  <p>The community involvement card will include the student&#39;s activities to date (if any).  If the student has completed the minimum 40 hours, the check mark will appear in the &#39;Community involvement (40 hours)&#39; box.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/stu-comm-inv-2.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 1024px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Use the <strong>Add icon</strong> to add a new community involvement activity. As new activities are added, the total time is summed and appears in the bottom right corner. When the total is 40 hours or more, the Community involvement (40 hours) is automatically checked. When this is checked, the student is considered as having completed the community involvement requirement for the OSSD. This box may be checked even if the activities do not total 40 hours (and all reports will consider the student as having completed 40 hours rather than the total that is less than 40).</p>

  <p>If an activity needs to be edited, or deleted, select the activity (row click) to access the Edit option.  The delete icon will appear in the edit tool bar.</p>
