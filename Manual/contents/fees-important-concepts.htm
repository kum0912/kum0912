  <h1>Fees - Important concepts</h1>
  <hr align="center" style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" />
  <p>The summary view will be different for each student, depending upon the status of the student’s accounts with the school. The summary may include up to 3 cards to convey the student’s account status: Account balance card (every student will have this), Unpaid fees card (appears only if the student has unpaid fees), and Payment credits card (appears only if the student has payment credits – money not associated with any fees).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Note: the information in the summary may include references to due dates. Schools choose to track due dates on every fee. When a fee is not paid by the due date, it is considered overdue. If a school does not track due dates, any area of fees references to due dates or overdue unpaid fees will be disabled.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><a id="account_balance"></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:18pt">Account balance</span></p>
  <p>Every student will have an Account balance card on the SUMMARY tab. The student’s account balance will be displayed in the app bar. In this example, the student has $10.00 in outstanding fees:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If the student has paid more than they owe, the balance will be a negative number and will appear with brackets, as shown here:</p>
  <p>  </p>
  <p>The Account balance card may have slight variations by student. Here are some examples :</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:16px;">• Student has paid all fees and has an account balance of zero:</span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:16px;"></span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:16px">• School uses due dates, and the student has unpaid fees. Some of the <span style="margin-left:24px">unpaid fees</span> are overdue, and some are not yet overdue:</span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:16px;"></span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:16px;">• School does not use due dates, and the student has outstanding fees <span style="margin-left:24px">and no payment credits.</span></span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><a id="unpaid_fees"></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:18pt">Unpaid fees</span></p>
  <p>The Unpaid fees card will only appear if the student has fees that are not yet paid (e.g. outstanding fees). The card will list the student’s fees with balances greater than zero (e.g. unpaid fees). Any fees listed in the card may be selected to access the options to edit the fee, make a payment, or see the details of the fee.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If the student has no fees assigned, or has paid all their fees, the Unpaid fees card will not appear. Fees that have been paid can be seen in the TRANSACTIONS tab which lists all activity with respect to the student’s fees (fees, payments, refunds, deposits, and reversals due to NSF).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><a id="payment_credits"></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:18pt">Payment credits</span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The card titled Payment credits will only appear if the student has money in their account, but that money is not applied to any fee. This typically only happens if payments were made prior to the fees being applied to the student, a course fee was returned, or an over payment of a fee was made so there is extra money in the student’s account.   </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>See Payment credits for more information. This section will show you how to apply the payment credit to outstanding fees using this icon:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Apply credit to fees icon</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>It will also show you how to refund all or part of the money using the refund icon in the card’s tool bar.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FAB to add fees and make payments:</p>
  <p><img height="130" src="assets/images/fab fees.jpg" width="68" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Regardless of the contents of the student’s SUMMARY tab, a floating action button (FAB) will appear in the lower right corner. When selected, the Add fee and Payment icons are available to add new fees or to make payments. See Fees and Payments for details.</p>
