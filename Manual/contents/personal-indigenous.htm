<p>The Personal menu option in a student’s record contains student-specific

 the student attends. Only the school that is the record owner can edit 
 this information.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Indigenous</h2>
<p>edsembli SIS has an application to create an XML file containing student 
 Nominal Roll specific information, which is uploaded to Indigenous and 
 Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) via their School Information System Export 
 (SISE) application. These are all the fields under the subheader &#39;Indigenous 
 and Northern Affairs Canada info&#39; as explained later.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Different provinces may require additional fields for part of their 
 Ministry reporting as follows:</p>
<p><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">British Columbia only</span>: Students 
 will have a Yes/No field called Aboriginal ancestry which should be set 
 to yes, if applicable. This field is used in the 1701 data collections 
 for the Ministry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alberta only</span>: Students who have 
 self-identified as First Nations, Metis, or Inuit should have their declaration 
 recorded in the FNMI declaration field (first field on the card) so that 
 it may be reported to PASI for funding purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saskatchewan only</span>: Students 
 will have an Aboriginal status field that is used in the SDS reporting. 
 Select a value if the student is an aboriginal student: Non-status Indian, 
 Metis, and Inuit/Inuk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manitoba only:  </span>Students 
 may have up to 4 Aboriginal cultural-linguistic identities entered by 
 selecting from the following values defined by the division using Setup 
 &gt; Indigenous &gt; Aboriginal identities. These 4 identities are reported 
 to the Ministry in the EIS data collection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ontario only</span>: OnSIS collect&#39;s 
 the student&#39;s FNMI declaration and the date it was received.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Please refer to the government&#39;s nominal 
 roll documentation if additional clarification is needed for any of the 
 fields in this area. Many of the Indigenous fields use drop down lists 
 to select the most appropriate value for the student. Some of the fields 
 use user-defined tables that are set up by the board/division/district 
 using Setup &gt; Indigenous. The following tables are user-defined: Bands, 
 Reserves, Status codes, Districts of financial responsibility, Accommodations, 
 and Residence statuses. <span style="font-weight: normal;">Provinces may 
 also have additional tables in the same set up area. Values provided below 
 should be set up with the codes noted in brackets (e.g. On reserve (1) 
 represents a value in the table called &#39;On reserve&#39; with the Ministry 
 code of 1).</span></p>

 table previously contained statuses such as::</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Unknown</li>
	<li>Child of government employees</li>

 have only one district, several regions have several districts. For example, 
 Ontario has four districts: Sudbury, Southern, Western and Sioux Lookout. 
 Historically, this code has been used for funding purposes. This coding 
 has been designated by Lands and Trust Services, as each band and tribal 
 council belongs to a specific district.</p>
