<p> </p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Course selections option provides access to the courses the student 
 would like to take in the next school year.  The school will use 
 these course selections to schedule classes and to create the students’ 
 new timetables for the new school year. The Course selections option is 
 available to students with the school year status of ‘This year and next 
 year’ or ‘Next year only’, and courses must exist in the school’s next 
 year’s courses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note:  Rather than entering the course 
 selections for the students, often the students enter their own course 
 selections using edsembli CONNECT.  Other schools use third party 
 career planning applications where students record their selections and 
 these selections are automatically imported into the SIS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Choose Class info &gt; Course selections from the submenu of the student’s 
 record. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-course-selections.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:262px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Course selections option includes 3 cards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;"><a href="#Add_course_selections">Add 
 course selections</a></span>:  This card is used to add new course 
 selections for the student.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;"><a href="#Preferred_courses">Preferred 
 courses</a></span>:  These are the courses that the student would 
 prefer to have in their timetable next year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;"><a href="#Alternate_courses">Alternate 
 courses</a></span>:  These are the courses that the student would 
 like to take if unable to get into a preferred course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each preferred course has an optional check box for “Course can be substituted 
 with an alternate course if necessary”. The automatic process for creating 
 the students’ timetables (called ‘load students’) has an option to allow 
 automatic replacement of a preferred courses with an alternate course 
 rather than leave the student with a conflict in their timetable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the school grants student access to edit course selections online, 
 the school may optionally lock specific courses so that they may not be 
 removed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a id="Select_Schools"></a>Select Schools</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p>If the student is attending other schools next year, use the drop down 
 arrow to select a different school and see the student’s course selections 
 at the other school. Select all schools to see all the courses selected 
 by the student at all the schools in your board/division.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Add_course_selections"></a>Add course selections</h2>
<p>Use this card to add the student’s course selections. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>First, set the defaults by selecting either the Preferred or Alternate 
 option. This determines whether the course will appear in the preferred 
 or alternate cards. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next, optionally check the boxes “Course can be substituted with an 
 alternate course if necessary” and “Locked” if they are to be set to yes 
 for the course(s) to be added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-course-sel-add.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:753px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the defaults are set, select the box called “Add by typing course 
 then hit enter or select from list”.  Start typing the course code 
 until it appears in the list of matching courses as shown below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the course from the list by clicking the course or pressing the 
 Enter key.  It will then be added to either the Preferred courses 
 or Alternate courses card. Continue to enter course codes, and selecting 
 them, until all of the student’s course selections are added.  Adjust 
 the defaults, as needed, before adding courses with different settings. 
 </p>
<h2><a id="Preferred_courses"></a>Preferred courses</h2>
<p>Preferred courses are those courses that the student would like to take 
 next year. These are the courses that the automatic scheduling tools will 
 try to place into the student&#39;s next year timetable.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/preferred-courses.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:811px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When a course has a check mark in the Locked column, students with will 
 not be able to remove the course if given access to this feature in edsembli 
 CONNECT.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a course has a check mark in the Substitute column, then the course 
 may be automatically substituted for an alternate course under these conditions:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The school has opted to use the automatic substitution feature 
	 when running the process to load the students into their timetables; 
	 AND</li>
	<li>The preferred course cannot be scheduled into the student’s timetable 
	 due to a conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the row with the preferred course to access the Edit function, 
 which also includes the delete icon, if the course selection is to be 
 removed:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/edit-course-selection.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:414px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Alternate_courses"></a>Alternate courses</h2>
<p>Alternate courses are those courses that the student would like to take 
 next year if unable to get into a preferred course.  Alternate courses 
 are often recorded for reference purposes only, but they may be optionally 
 substituted for a preferred course as described earlier.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/alt-courses.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:812px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a course has a check mark in the Locked column, the student is unable 
 to remove that course if given access to course selections in edsembli 
 CONNECT.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the row with the alternate course to access the Edit function, 
 including the delete icon, if the course selection is to be removed.:</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Course_selection_approval"></a>Course selection approval</h2>
<p>Some schools like to personally review each student&#39;s course selections 
 and approve the student&#39;s courses. This is an optional step as the scheduling 
 tools will use the student&#39;s course selections even if they are not approved. 
  An icon will appear in the Add course selections tool bar to indicate 
 whether or not the courses are approved. Click the icon to approve/unapprove 
 the student&#39;s courses. It will automatically track the user and date of 
 the approval.</p>
