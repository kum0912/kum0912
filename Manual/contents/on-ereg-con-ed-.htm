<h1>Continuing education credit courses</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p></p>
 <p>The Continuing education credit courses 
 option provides Ontario schools and boards with the ability to generate 
 the official Register of Enrolment in Continuing Education Credit Courses. 
 This is a classroom-based register used to record enrolment and attendance 
 for pupils in continuing education (CE) courses taken for credit. This 
 register option is available to Ontario boards and schools set up with 
 ‘school operating type’ of continuing education. Occasionally, a board 
 will allow a CE student to register in a credit course at a summer school. 
 Therefore, this option is also available for summer schools so that these 
 CE students can print on the CE Credit Course Register rather than the 
 Summer School Register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The courses must be provided through classroom instruction *:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>During the school year</li>
	<li>In the summer</li>
	<li>From September to August  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Credit courses may be offered:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>During the day school instructional program  </li>
	<li>At night or on the weekend  </li>
	<li>At the end of the day school instructional program and ending before 
	 5 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>* With the exception of the pupil’s placement component of a cooperative 
 education course</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This register may include pupils exclusively enrolled in CE, part-time 
 day pupils. Full-time day pupils taking CE credit courses will appear 
 on the register, however their attendance at sessions will not be funded 
 unless the start time is after the end of the school day. If the full-time 
 day pupil is to receive CE funding as well, set the student’s Con. Ed. 
 Student Type to ‘Also attends day school’.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Schools and boards should be familiar with the official Ministry enrolment 
 register instructions for continuing education programs. These instructions 
 are updated annually on the Ministry’s site <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html">http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html</a>. 
 This includes detailed information on which courses to include on this 
 register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please be familiar with the <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a> option in the student’s record. This 
 will provide detailed information on the enrolment register(s) the student 
 will appear on, as well as high credit and regular FTE/ADE info. Hint: 
 on the FTE and/or ADE card in the student’s record, there’s a Details 
 section that may be expanded to show info on how FTE/ADE is calculated, 
 and how the student’s data impacts the register. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Continuing 
 education credit classes are reported as ADE.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Set up classes that need to appear on the Register of Continuing Education 
 Credit Courses</h2>
<p>If a class is to appear in the Continuing Education Credit Courses register, 
 it must be set up (<a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Setup &gt; 
 Class info &gt; Classes</a>) as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The course offering type must be set to one of the following:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Adult Credit – Offered at night/weekend</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Adult Credit – Offered during day school</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Adult Credit – Offered after end of day 
 school</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Cont Ed: Transfer credit on Math</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Cont Ed: Additional prep for changing course 
 types</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Enter the most appropriate Delivery and Course delivery type<br/>
	</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:652px;" border="0"/><br/>
</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Since funding is based on attendance, make sure that the class 
	 schedule, start and end dates, and period times are accurate. Make 
	 sure each student’s add/drop dates are accurate (add date is the first 
	 day attending the class, drop date is the first date of non-attendance 
	 in the class).</li>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<h3>Teachers track classroom attendance</h3>
<p>Teachers are responsible for taking accurate classroom attendance, just 
 like any regular class.  The class schedule, start/end dates, and 
 the school’s calendar will define what dates the teacher is expected to 
 take attendance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Cancelled instructional sessions – Funded cancelled session “C”</h3>
<p>Where an instructional session has been cancelled owing to exceptional 
 circumstances (such as bad weather or an emergency) and the instructor 
 is paid, the session will be recognized for funding purposes. These sessions 
 are included in the total number of sessions recognized for funding. The 
 funded cancelled session must be marked with a “C” on the register and 
 the reason for the cancellation must be recorded. To cancel a funded session, 
 follow these instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Use <a href="../attendance/att-enter-groupex.htm">Attendance &gt; 
	 Enter attendance &gt; Group/Excursion</a>.  Select the date and 
	 group of students (e.g. all students or a specific class).</li>
	<li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, 
	 scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select 
	 the option select the option c Cancelled.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned-cancel.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:593px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Record an attendance note describing the reason for the cancellation.</li>
	<li>Apply (save) the attendance for the group.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: If the “C” session is rescheduled, 
 the instructor should not be paid for the rescheduled session and the 
 rescheduled session must not be included in the total number of sessions 
 recognized for funding purposes. See Rescheduled instructional sessions.</span></p>
<h3>Cancelled instructional sessions – Unfunded cancelled session “D”</h3>
<p>Where an instructional session has been cancelled (I.e. the teacher 
 is unavailable) and the instructor is not paid, the session will not be 
 recognized for funding purposes. Do not include this session in the total 
 number of sessions recognized for funding. The unfunded cancelled session 
 must be marked with a “D” on the register and the reason for the cancellation 
 must be recorded. To cancel an unfunded session, follow these instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Use <a href="../attendance/att-enter-groupex.htm">Attendance &gt; 
	 Enter attendance &gt; Group/excursion</a>.  Select the date and 
	 group of students (e.g. a specific class).</li>
	<li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, 
	 scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select 
	 the option select the option $ Cancelled Not Funded.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned-canceld.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:589px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: If the “D” session is rescheduled, 
 the instructor should be paid for the rescheduled session and the rescheduled 
 session must be included in the total number of sessions recognized for 
 funding purposes.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<h3>Rescheduled sessions  </h3>
<p>If a new session is to be added to the class, typically the class end 
 date is extended to accommodate the extra session. This is done using 
 <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Setup &gt; Class info &gt; 
 Classes</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the rescheduled session is due to a session that is given the code 
 “C” (funded cancelled session), the instructor should not be paid for 
 the rescheduled session and the rescheduled session must not be included 
 in the total number of sessions recognized for funding purposes. To reschedule 
 a session, and have it not appear in the register, follow these instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Use <a href="../attendance/att-enter-groupex.htm">Attendance &gt; 
	 Enter attendance &gt; Group/excursion</a>.  Select the date and 
	 group of students (e.g. All students or a specific class).</li>
	<li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, 
	 scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select 
	 the option select the option ^ Non-instructional Day</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned-resched.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:599px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Record an attendance note describing the reason the class is removed 
	 from the register (e.g. rescheduled session for the mm/yyyy funded 
	 cancelled session due to weather).</li>
	<li>Apply (save) the attendance for the group.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Generate the Register of Enrolment in Continuing Education Credit Courses</h3>
<p>To access the register, select Ontario reporting &gt; Enrolment registers 
 &gt; Continuing education credit courses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:202px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The form will look like this:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:596px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The list of classes will default any classes that are set up to appear 
 on this register. You may limit the classes using the filters, or select 
 an individual or range of classes to print.  A separate register 
 is generated for each selected class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the Print button located at the bottom of the form. Once the 
 report has been submitted to the task queue, you may leave this application 
 or generate other reports. You will receive notification when your report 
 is ready. Reports are saved in <a href="../setup/setup-file-manager.htm">file 
 manager</a> under Provincial &gt; Enrolment registers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Hint: See previously created registers 
 by selecting the folder icon to open file manager at this location.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The info generated on the register may also be exported in a CSV file 
 by checking the option shown below. The CSV file will be generated along 
 with the register report, as part of the submission to the task queue. 
   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-course-grant-export.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:280px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example of the register report:</p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned-report.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:869px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The top of the report will include the register name, school year, class 
 (course code &amp; section letter and course title).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned-reporttop.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:721px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each pupil in the class, it will include the following info from 
 the student’s record (in the Personal area):</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned-report1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:857px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Day school pupil’ column is populated with either FT (full-time), 
 PT (part-time) or blank (student is not a day school pupil) based on the 
 student’s field called ‘Con. Ed. Student type’ (in student record under 
 Enrolment &gt; Enrolment register info).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>FT appears if the student’s Con. Ed. Student Type is one of the following 
 types:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Full-time)</li>
	<li>Full-Time Day School (exclude from Register totals)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>PT appears if the student’s Con. Ed. Student Type is one of the following 
 types:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Part-time)</li>
	<li>Part-time taking same course(s) in day school (exclude from register 
	 totals).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Blank appears if the student’s Con. Ed. Student Type is:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Only Attends Con. Ed. School</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Residence Status’ column will show OP (Other Pupil) if the student 
 is considered an Other Pupil (OP). OP will appear if the board defined 
 student board residence status does not use ministry code 01, 06, 07, 
 or 09.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For students also attending day school, the ‘Day School Address’ column 
 will use the student’s origin school as recorded in the student’s record 
 in <a href="../students/enrolment-students.htm">Enrolment &gt; Student 
 enrolment</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To the right of the student info it will show the student’s attendance 
 at sessions. This info is based on the entry of attendance by the teachers. 
 The dates are based on the setup of the class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned-grid.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:874px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each date, a blank will appear if the student is present.  If 
 the student was not present at the session, one of the following 4 codes 
 will appear:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A      Pupil absence from a session</p>
<p>—     Late admission or early withdrawal (based 
 on the student’s class add/drop dates)</p>
<p>C       Funded cancelled session</p>
<p>D       Unfunded cancelled session</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each student’s total funded attendance sessions are summed in the far-right 
 columns (under either ‘Sept – June’ or ‘Summer’).   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned-report2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:98px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sessions recognized for funding will be summed if the student’s Con. 
 Ed. Student Type is:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Only Attends Con. Ed. School</li>
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Full-time)  </li>
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Part-time)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If a student is an “Other Pupil”, their sessions will not be recognized 
 for funding (their sessions are not summed). For pupils of the board, 
 the funded session sum will include all sessions where the student was 
 present (blank), Absent (A) *, or C (funded cancelled session).   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>* if the student is absent 3 or more consecutive sessions, these absences 
 are not funded (they are excluded from total). Cancelled sessions (“C” 
 or “D”) do not ‘break’ the consecutive absent count.  For example, 
 if a student had 5 consecutive absences in a row (Sept 26 to Oct 15), 
 as well as 3 consecutive absences on Jan 30, Feb 6 and Feb 11. The cancelled 
 session on Feb 4 does not count as a consecutive absence, but it also 
 does not break the count of consecutive absences. Therefore, if there 
 was a possible 40 sessions that the student could attend, the school will 
 receive funding for 32 sessions (40 - 5 - 3 = 32).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sessions recognized for funding will exclude sessions when the student’s 
 Con. Ed Type is:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Full-Time Day School (exclude from register totals)</li>
	<li>Part-time taking same course(s) in day school (exclude from register 
	 totals).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Since students may change Con. Ed. Types throughout the school year, 
 depending upon the date of the student&#39;s Con. Ed. Student Type change 
 (as recorded in the student’s <a href="../students/enrolment-internal-transfers.htm">internal 
 transfers</a>), some sessions may be counted. Using an example of a student 
 who changes from Only Attends Con. Ed. School (which is funded on this 
 CE register) to Full-time Day school (which is not funded on this CE register), 
 the date of the change will impact the sessions counted as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Internal transfer date is prior to 10/31:  it will exclude 
	 all sessions (because the student received FT funding on the OnSIS 
	 count Oct 31/Mar 31 dates).</li>
	<li>Internal transfer date is after 10/31 and before March 31: it will 
	 count all sessions between Sept 1 and Jan 31 (and then the student 
	 will receive FT funding on the OnSIS Mar 31 count date).</li>
	<li>Internal transfer date is after March 31 date: it will count all 
	 sessions (the student does not get FT funding for either Oct or March, 
	 but receives the CE funding instead).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The sessions recognized for funding will be summed for all students 
 in the class, at the bottom of the register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned-report3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:296px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the student details page, a summary page is included with an area 
 for the principal to certify the register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-coned-report4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:546px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Hours per session’ is based on the daily average minutes of instruction 
 set up for the class (using <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Setup 
 &gt; Class info &gt; Classes</a>). This may be based on period times, 
 or it may be manually entered directly into the daily average minutes 
 of instruction field. The minutes will be converted to hours on this register.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Funding - OnSIS reporting of classes on the Continuing Education Registers</h2>
<p>Funding is based on the information submitted to OnSIS.  See <a href="on-onsis-coned-night-school.htm">OnSIS &gt; Night/continuing 
 education school &gt; ConEd/Night school info</a> for details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the Ministry’s instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Elemental data is collected once a 
 year on August 31 for the entire school year (September-August). Submit 
 data through the Continuing Education and/or Summer School submissions 
 (School Special Condition Type “N – Continuing Education” or “8 – Summer”).</span> 
  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course Offering Type must be reported for each course for each student. 
 Course Offering Types include:</p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The following Class Enrolment fields are mandatory:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li> <span style="font-style: italic;">Course Schedule Indicator

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The corresponding ADE value must also 
 be reported for each course in the “ADE – September to June” or “ADE – 
 Summer” fields.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>ADE calculations for classes on the Continuing Education Credit Courses 
 registers</h2>
<p>The calculation of the average daily enrolment (ADE) is calculated as 
 follows:</p>
<p>ADE = # of sessions recognized for funding x hours per session / 950</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other reports</h2>
<p>The board may want to run this option to check students’ continuing 
 education student type is set correctly for those students also enrolled 
 in day school:</p>
