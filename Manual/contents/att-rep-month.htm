<p><a name="Monthly_attendance_register" id="Monthly_attendance_register"></a>This 
 report lists students along with their daily attendance for any selected 
 month.  </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>See <a href="att-rep-common-features.htm">Attendance reports common 
 features</a> for detailed information on the presentation of the student’s 
 attendance in this report.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Choose Attendance &gt; Reports &gt;Monthly attendance or Student reports 
 &gt; Attendance &gt; Monthly attendance. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This report is run for the students with the morning/afternoon attendance 
 method by selecting the <a href="#AM_PM">AM/PM button</a> on the card, 
 and is run for the students with the ‘by period’ attendance method by 
 selecting the <a href="#BY_PERIOD">BY PERIOD</a> button on the card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:204px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="AM_PM"></a>AM/PM</h2>
<p>Select AM/PM and the Student reports - Monthly attendance screen will 
 appear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sturep-att-month-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:699px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select a print order from the header drop down list. Alphabet is the 
 default but you can also choose Class, Group, Grade, Excursion, Homeroom, 
 Defined character, and Advisor group. See Student reports common features 
 for more <a href="../students/stu-reports-commonfeatures.htm">Print order 
 information</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include students registered</span> 
 - Select the registered type, both this year and next year. This year 
 only (not returning), Next year only or Withdrawn (no longer enrolled 
 this year).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attendance codes</span> - <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: 
 This setup option only appears when the report is run for the students 
 with the morning/afternoon attendance method.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Use school attendance codes</span>:<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span> This will show the exact 
 attendance code (A –Z) assigned to the student.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Use official attendance codes</span>: 
 This will show official codes only (e.g. S – Sick recorded for a student 
 will show as A – Absent). Each school attendance code has an equivalent 
 official code to indicate whether the code is considered Present, Absent, 
 Late, Suspended, or Grant day (for unexpected school closures due to weather, 
 infrastructure issues).</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: By period students may not have 
 this option available if the report is converting the attendance to AM/PM 
 as explained in ‘By period’ attendance method – conversion to AM/PM.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional information</span> - Select 
 Lates or Presence as % by possible days. The monthly attendance report 
 will include 3 columns for absence information for each student. Here 
 is an example:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep10.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:181px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Using the example above, the 1st student in the list was absent 0 mornings 
 and 0 afternoons for the month printed. For the month, the student was 
 absent 0 days of 9 possible school days. The accumulated attendance so 
 far this year is 3 absences out of 40 possible days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 3rd student in the list was absent 3 mornings and 2 afternoons for 
 the month printed, which is equivalent to 2.5 days absent during the month. For 
 the month, the student was absent 2.5 days of 19 possible school days. The 
 accumulated attendance so far this year is 10.5 absences out of 89 possible 
 days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select from the following options to determine which additional information 
 is included to the right of the absence information:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Lates</span>: This option will show 
 the number of lates the student had for the month, and the accumulated 
 number of lates since the start of the school year. If a student 
 is late in the morning and late in the afternoon, it is counted as 2 times 
 late.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the example below, the 1st student was absent 0 times this month 
 but has 1 late since the start of the school year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep12.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:71px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Presence as a % of possible days</span>: This 
 option will convert the student’s attendance into percentage of time the 
 student was present at school for the month and the accumulated (Acc.) 
 total for the school year.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>In the example below, the 1st student was absent 0 days out of 9 possible 
 days (0/9 in the 1st Tot. column), and therefore the student was present 
 9/9 days or 100% of the time (the 2nd Tot. column). Since the start of 
 the school year, the student was absent 3 out of 40 possible days. Therefore, 
 the student was present 37 of the 40 days (40 -3). This is represented 
 as 93% present (37/40 x 100) in the 2nd Acc. Column.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Report parameters</span> - This is 
 where you select the month to be printed and can optionally include the 
 legend explaining the calendar and attendance codes. <a href="att-rep-common-features.htm#Legends">See 
 Common attendance features – Legends</a> for more information. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Students with the &#39;by period&#39; attendance method, the attendance will 
 be converted into am/pm based on the period defined as the first afternoon 
 period.  This period will appear in the Report parameters when applicable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example of the monthly attendance report:</p>
