<h1>IS &amp; e-learning for day schools</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<p>The IS &amp; e-learning for day schools option provides Ontario schools 
 and boards with the ability to generate the official Independent Study 
 and e-Learning Register for Day School Pupils. This class-based register 
 will include the students enrolled in classes that are set up with either 
 the ‘Delivery’ or ‘Course Delivery type’ set to ‘Independent Study’.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Schools and boards should be familiar with the official Ministry enrolment 
 register instructions for elementary and secondary schools that are updated 
 annually on the Ministry’s site <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html">http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html</a>. 
 The principal will ensure that a system is in place to determine whether 
 a pupil is to be enrolled as a <a href="on-ereg-full-time.htm">Full-time</a> 
  or a <a href="on-ereg-part-time.htm">Part-time</a> pupil, or  Independent 
 Study (e.g. student is enrolled in classes that are to be reported on 
 the Independent Study and e-Learning Register), as described here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Enrolment in e-learning courses is normally recorded in the day school 
 enrolment register (e.g. FT or PT registers) in the same way as enrolment 
 in courses delivered in the classroom. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The 
 only exception is the recording of enrolment for pupils who decline to 
 enrol in a school of the local district school board</span> – usually 
 pupils receiving home schooling or attending a private school. If these 
 home schooled/private schooled pupils are receiving some instruction provided 
 by the school they must be recorded in the Independent Study and e-Learning 
 Register for Day School Pupils (for IS and e-learning courses) by the 
 school that is offering the course, or in the day school register (for 
 classroom-delivered courses).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A day school pupil enrolled in “independent study” is not registered 
 for classroom instruction, but takes credit courses that fulfil the Ministry’s 
 program and diploma requirements and meets with qualified teachers for 
 scheduled times during the school day. It should be noted that a course 
 cannot be considered an independent study course if any portion of it 
 consists of classroom instructional time that is also used to classify 
 the pupil as either “full-time” or “part-time.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Full-time and part-time students may enroll in IS classes, and these 
 students will appear on the register, however the funding (based on completed 
 work units) may be impacted.  Some schools will set a student’s attendance 
 type to Independent Study (in the student’s record using <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a>), to distinguish regular full and part-time 
 day students from those students exclusively enrolled in classes that 
 appear on the IS &amp; e-Learning register. Setting the attendance type 
 to Independent Study for these students is optional (they will be sent 
 to OnSIS as if they are part-time students).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please be familiar with the <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a> option in the student’s record. This 
 will provide detailed information on the enrolment register(s) the student 
 will appear on, as well as high credit and regular FTE/ADE info. Hint: 
 on the FTE and/or ADE card in the student’s record, there’s a Details 
 section that may be expanded to show info on how FTE/ADE is calculated, 
 and how the student’s data impacts the register. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Independent 
 study classes are reported as ADE rather than FTE.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Independent Study courses are divided into a number of specific units 
 of work that are similar in value, and these units are used to measure 
 the pupil’s progress. Work units must be completed, not necessarily successfully, 
 in order to be recognized for grant purposes, and the student must not 
 exceed the number required to complete the course. This is defined during 
 the setup of the classes that need to appear on the IS and e-Learning 
 register.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Set up classes that need to appear on the IS and e-Learning register</h3>
<p>If a class is to appear in the IS and e-Learning registers, it must 
 be set up (Setup &gt; Class info &gt; Classes) as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>In a regular school, when adding/editing a grade 9 to 12 course, 
	 check the box “Class needs to appear on the Independent Study and 
	 e-Learning Register for Day pupils”.   </li>
	<li>Set either the Delivery or Course Delivery type to Independent 
	 Study. For example, private/home schooled students would have a class 
	 that is set up as Delivery = e-Learning &amp; Course delivery type 
	 = Independent Study; students taking an independent study class during 
	 the day may have Delivery = Day &amp; Course delivery type = Independent 
	 Study.</li>
	<li>Enter the # of work units and # of teacher contact sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-IS-elearn-classes.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:540px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the class is not scheduled in a specific period, set the minutes 
 of instruction to reflect the average number of minutes for the teacher 
 contact session. This value will appear on the summary page of the class 
 register.   </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Teachers_track_contact_sessions_and_completed_work_units" id="Teachers_track_contact_sessions_and_completed_work_units"></a>Teachers 
 track contact sessions and completed work units</h3>
<p>The teacher of the class will need to track the student’s progress through 
 the course by entering a ‘mark’ when a work unit is completed (does not 
 need to be successfully completed to be recognized for grant purposes). 
 Any mark other than zero will be considered a completed work unit on the 
 register.*  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The teacher will have a markbook category called ‘Work Units Completed’, 
 with markbook items Unit 1, Unit 2 … up to the # of units set up for the 
 class.  This is an example of what the teacher will see:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-IS-elearn-teacher-contact-sessions.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:306px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>* Teachers may want to change the titles from Unit 1, etc, to a title 
 that reflects the course material in the unit.  Since students may 
 complete units at different times or different orders, the date the mark 
 was entered is automatically recorded and will appear beside the mark 
 as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-IS-elearn-teacher-contact-sessions1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:95px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The teacher may select this date and change it.  Teachers should 
 make sure this date accurately represents the student’s completion date. 
 For students who received full-time funding on the October and/or March 
 count date, the student’s completion date is used to determine whether 
 or not the work unit is included (funded) on the register. The date is 
 also used in determining if the work unit is funded at the regular or 
 high-credit rate based on whether the student has reached the high credit 
 threshold on the October/March count dates).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Similarly, the teacher of the class will need to track contact sessions 
 with the student by entering a ‘mark’ of A (absent), or P (Present) for 
 each contact session throughout the duration of the course. The teacher 
 will have a markbook category called ‘Teacher Contact Sessions’, with 
 markbook items Session 1, Session 2 … up to the # of contact sessions 
 set up for the class. The teacher should set the date to accurately represent 
 the date of the contact session. This is an example of what the teacher 
 will see:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-IS-elearn-teacher-contact-sessions2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:343px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The information recorded by teachers is used on the register printouts, 
 and impacts funding.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Generate the IS &amp; e-Learning Register for Day School Pupils  </h3>
<p>To access the register, choose Ontario reporting &gt; Enrolment registers 
 &gt; IS &amp; e-learning for day schools.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-IS-elearn-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:202px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select GO on the IS &amp; e-learning for day schools card and you will 
 see a form like this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-IS-elearn-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:754px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The list of classes will default any class that has independent study 
 set up in the class fields for the Delivery or Type of course. You may 
 limit the classes using the filters, or select an individual or range 
 of classes to print.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the Print button located at the bottom of the form. Once the 
 report has been submitted to the task queue, you may leave this application 
 or generate other reports. You will receive notification when your report 
 is ready. Reports are saved in <a href="../setup/setup-file-manager.htm">file 
 manage</a>r under Provincial &gt; Enrolment registers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hint: See previously created registers by selecting the folder icon 
 to open file manager at this location.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example of the register report:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-IS-elearn-sample.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:720px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The top of the report will include the register name, school year, class 
 (course code &amp; section letter and course title).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-IS-elearn-sample1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:517px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each pupil in the class, it will include the following info:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-IS-elearn-sample2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:596px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student is 21 or older as of December 31st of the current school 
 year, an ’A’ will appear in the Adult column.  If the student’s board 
 residence status does not use ministry code 01, 06, 07, or 09, then OP 
 will print in the Other Pupils column, and the individuals or organization 
 responsible for payment of the student’s fees will appear in column B 
 as recorded in the student’s record (<a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a>).   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student is a pupil of the board, the student’s high credit factor 
 will appear. * See OnSIS funding (below) for further details on whether 
 the student’s high credit factor on October or March or an average of 
 the two factors is used. Regulations exist to determine whether the student 
 is deemed to be enrolled in the courses on Oct 31 or Mar 31 and whether 
 the course can be deemed to be a semestered course or non-semestered course 
 (<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/180286">https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/180286</a> 
 - see Independent Study Courses regulation 6).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To the right of the student info it will show the student’s contact 
 sessions (in the row labelled ’A’) and work units completed (in the row 
 labelled ’B’). This info is based on the teacher’s entries as explained 
 below. The completion date will be the date the student completed or dropped 
 the class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-IS-elearn-sample3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:721px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Attendance at teacher-contact sessions</span>: 
 The letter A will show if the teacher entered a mark of A (absent). A 
 check mark will appear if the teacher entered a mark of P (Present).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Work Units completed</span>: The letter 
 C will show if the teacher entered any mark other than zero. It will show 
 C for each unit completed, regardless of the completion order (e.g. if 
 a student has completed units 2, 4, 5 only, it will show C in units 1, 
 2, and 3 on the register).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are times when completed units are omitted from the register because 
 the student cannot receive funding for these units. Here are the situations:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>If the student was enrolled as a full-time day school pupil on 
	 the October count date, the number of work units completed must exclude 
	 the work units completed during the period September 1 to January 
	 31 of the current school year.</li>
	<li>If the student was enrolled as a full-time day school pupil on 
	 the March count date, the number of work units completed must exclude 
	 the work units completed during the period February 1 to June 30 of 
	 the current school year.</li>
	<li>If the student is enrolled as a part-time day school pupil, and 
	 is taking the same course as part of their day school instructional 
	 program, all completed work units are excluded.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>A summary of the student’s contact sessions and work units completed 
 will appear on the far right of the report as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-IS-elearn-sample4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:309px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sections labelled as A and B, as described below, are based on the teacher 
 entries (for more info, see <a href="#Teachers_track_contact_sessions_and_completed_work_units">Teachers 
 track contact sessions and completed work units</a>). Pupils under 21 
 and over 21 (based on age as of December 31) are in separate columns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Sessions scheduled</span>:  the sum 
 of the sessions with an A (absent) or check mark (present).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Sessions attended</span>:  the sum 
 of the sessions with a check mark (present).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Total number of work units completed</span>: 
  the sum of the work units with a C.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Regular and High-credit columns (E1 and E2) are calculated for non-adult 
 pupils of the board who have met the over 34 non-exempt credit threshold 
 during the time the student is taking the class. The values in these columns 
 are best explained by examples:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Example 1:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">On the October 31 and March 31 count dates, 
 the student has not reached the 34 credit threshold (e.g. student is not 
 high credit). This student will not show any values in column E1 and E2. 
 This class will count as regular ADE.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Example 2:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Student is enrolled in an independent study 
 class during the first semester, and completed it during the first semester. 
  The student was not high credit on October 31 but became high credit 
 on March 31. This student will not show any values in column E1 and E2 
 for this class. This class will count as regular ADE.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Example 3:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Student is enrolled in a 2 credit independent 
 study class from September 10 - June 5. The student was not high credit 
 on October 31 (high credit factor = 0) but became high credit as of March 
 31 (high credit factor = .5).  The register will show 0.25 for the 
 high credit factor (e.g. the average high credit factor (0 + .5 divided 
 by 2).  </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Each work unit completed by the student 
 is dated. Using these dates, the student’s work units were completed as 
 follows:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">10 work units completed between 
	 September 10 and October 31.</p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;"> 20 work units completed between 
	 November 1 and March 31.</p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;"> 6 work units completed between 
	 April 1 and June 5.  </p></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">The 10 work units completed on or before 
 October 31 are all count as regular ADE.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">The work 26 units completed after October 
 31 are counted partially as regular ADE and partially as high credit ADE. 
 These are considered ‘work units when the student is high credit’ (even 
 though the student may not have been high credit for the whole time). 
  </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">High-credit (column E2):  Total number 
 of work units completed when the student was high credit X high credit 
 factor (rounded to whole number)  </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">E2= 26 x 0.25 = 6.5 (rounded to 7)</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Regular (column E1):  Total work units 
 completed up to October 31 + a proportion of the work units completed 
 when the student was high credit. Proportion = total work units completed 
 when the student was high credit – E2.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">E1 = 10 + (26-7) = 29  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bottom of the student details page shows totals for all the columns 
 in the register.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Funding - OnSIS reporting of classes on the IS and e-Learning registers</h2>
<p style="font-style: italic;">The following text is directly from the 
 Ministry’s instructions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For independent study, the average daily enrolment (ADE) will be reported 
 through OnSIS on three submission dates – the last school day of October, 
 March, and June. The ADE reported for each pupil should be based on the 
 portion of work units completed by the pupil since the last OnSIS submission 
 date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The enrolment of each pupil in independent study courses must be considered 
 under the appropriate category in the chart below for the purposes of 
 determining a pupil’s “high-credit factor” and calculating the pupil’s 
 ADE for independent study. The “regular” and “high-credit” ADE reported 
 through OnSIS for each pupil should be based on the portion of work units 
 completed by the pupil since the last OnSIS submission date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-IS-elearn-sample7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:595px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a pupil is admitted to a classroom-delivered day school course or 
 program after an enrolment-count date, his or her enrolment in that course 
 or program cannot be recorded in the Independent Study and e-Learning 
 Register for Day School Pupils or a continuing education register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IS pupil may have been enrolled as a Full-Time day school pupil 
 on the October and/or March enrolment-count dates. However, these pupils 
 are not eligible for funding and their lessons/work units marked must 
 not be included in the total number of lessons/work units submitted to 
 OnSIS for funding purposes. For pupils enrolled as FT on the October enrolment-count 
 date, the number of lessons/work units marked must be subtracted from 
 the total number of lessons/work units marked during the period September 
 1, 2018, to January 31, 2019. Likewise, for pupils enrolled as FT on the 
 March enrolment-count date, the number of lessons/work units marked must 
 be subtracted from the total number of lessons/work units marked during 
 the period February 1, 2019, to June 30, 2019.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>ADE calculations for classes on the IS and e-Learning registers</h2>
<p>The calculation of the average daily enrolment (ADE) for secondary pupils 
 is split into two categories: “regular” and “high credit.” All or a portion 
 of the credits of pupils affected by the 34-credit threshold may be identified 
 as “high credits.” “High credits” are the credits above the 34-credit 
 threshold that are for “nonexempt courses” taken in the current school 
 year or semester by “non-exempt pupils.” Examples of “exempt courses” 
 are English as a Second Language and English Literacy Development. An 
 example of an “exempt pupil” is a pupil with an Individual Education Plan 
 [IEP].  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>ADE (regular and high credit) is reported to OnSIS in the Student School 
 Enrolment batch file. The ADE reported is the sum of all independent study 
 classes (and e-learning classes that appear on this register) that the 
 student is enrolled in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: the Ministry is aware that there 
 are slight variations in the ADE reporting between OnSIS (which is by 
 student) and the legacy EFIS report (by class).</span>   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The OnSIS calculation of ADE for classes on the IS and e-Learning registers 
 considers <span style="font-weight: bold;">the sum of the credit values 
 and completed work units for all the classes</span> the student is taking 
 that appear on the register:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Regular ADE</span> = Credit Value x 
 Proportion of work units completed after last count date ÷ 7.5 x (1 - 
 high credit factor)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">High Credit ADE</span> = Credit Value 
 x Proportion of work units completed after last count date ÷ 7.5 x high 
 credit factor</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Example</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">On October 31, a student has 1 regular class 
 (1 credit) &amp; 2 independent study classes (1 credit each), and 33 non-exempt 
 credits in their transcripts.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">High Credits</span> 
 = transcript credits + timetable credits – 34  </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">33 + 3 – 34 = 2 high credits</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enrolled

 [A - (34 – B)] divided by C  (e.g.  [3 - (34-33)] divided by 
 3).</p>

<p>March 31 and June 30 OnSIS submissions: The student’s March ADE calculations 
 would be based on 13/40 units completed, using the student’s March high 
 credit factor. The student’s June ADE calculations would be based on 11/40 
 units completed, using the student’s March high credit factor (since there 
 is no June high credit factor).</p>
