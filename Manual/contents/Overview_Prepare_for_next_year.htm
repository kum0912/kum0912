<h1>Overview - Prepare for next year </h1>
<p>In the winter, schools typically start preparing for the forthcoming 
 school year. The first step is to ‘Prepare for next year’ which involves 
 some steps that are done once at the start of the scheduling progress. 
 </p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Initialize next year</li>
	<li>Lunches <span style="font-style: italic;">(not applicable to elementary 
	 schools)</span></li>
	<li>Sem/term/day period</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>These 3 steps correspond to the 3 cards found when you select Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Prepare for next year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-prepcards.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:640px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The student and school class information for the next school year is 
 distinct from the corresponding information for this school year. Each 
 year, when you are ready to start scheduling, you must first run the initialize 
 next year process. This process performs the following primary functions 
 based on the options selected as part of this process:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Sets the school year status to This Year Only for students attending 
	 the school this year in the school’s highest grade. Each student’s 
	 exit date, exit description, and destination school (if applicable) 
	 is set to the defaults set by the school. Students in the highest 
	 grade in the school are assumed to be leaving the school at the end 
	 of this year, and those who aren’t leaving can be adjusted manually 
	 after the process is completed.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Advances each student&#39;s grade next year based on the progression 
	 of grades set by the school. This year&#39;s grade is not changed.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Each student&#39;s homeroom next year can be removed (set to not assigned) 
	 or it may be set to the same homeroom as this year (if the list of 
	 homerooms is copied from this year to next year). Similarly, each 
	 student’s advisor group can be removed or set the same as this year.<br/>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Initialize next year has other functions as explained in <a href="sched-initialize-scheduling.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Prepare for next year &gt; Initialize next year</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When determining the best location to schedule classes, and when assigning 
 students into classes, if the school requires a period to be reserved 
 for a lunch break, the lunch periods have to be defined using <a href="sched-lunches.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Prepare for next year &gt; Lunches</a>.  Lunch periods 
 are optional, and often are not defined if all students share the same 
 lunch period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is imperative that you make sure your semester term and day/period 
 sets and patterns are defined correctly (<a href="sem-term-day-period.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Prepare for next year &gt; Sem/term/day/period</a>) as 
 explained in <a href="Scheduling_important_concepts.htm#Semester_term___day_period_sets_and_patterns__">Important 
 concepts</a>. </p>
