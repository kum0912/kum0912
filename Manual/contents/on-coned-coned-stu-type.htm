<h1>Continuing education student type</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<p>This option is available to Ontario publicly funded school boards only. 
 Schools do not have access to this report.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Continuing education student type option provides a report for boards 
 to ensure that each student that appears on a continuing education enrolment 
 register has the correct ‘Continuing education student type’ field (as 
 recorded in the student’s record under <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a>). Prior to submitting OnSIS batch files, 
 this report should be run for each OnSIS count date to ensure the students 
 have the correct type.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The student’s continuing education student type field is used to determine 
 whether a student is eligible for funding through some of the continuing 
 education enrolment registers, specifically the registers for credit courses, 
 correspondence/self-study/e-learning, and summer school.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, the Register of Enrolment in Continuing Education Credit 
 Courses and the Register of Enrolment in Correspondence/Self-Study/e-Learning 
 Courses have a count of sessions (lessons/work units) recognized for funding. 
 Sessions recognized for funding will be summed if the student’s Con. Ed. 
 Student Type is at least one of the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Only Attends Con. Ed. School</li>
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Full-time) *</li>
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Part-time) *</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>This register will exclude sessions for students when the student’s 
 Continued education student type (aka Con. Ed Type) is one of the following::</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Full-Time Day School (exclude from register totals)</li>
	<li>Part-time taking same course(s) in day school (exclude from register 
	 totals).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>* The summer school register will only include students with either 
 of these 2 types.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To access this report, from the board, select Ontario Reporting &gt; 
 Continuing education &gt; Continuing education student type.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-coned-stutype-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:202px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select Go on the Continuing education student type card to see this 
 form:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-coned-stutype-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:770px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the report date (October, March or June) corresponding to the 
 Onsis submission report dates.  The Report date will automatically 
 match the current year’s count dates (e.g. October 31, March 31, or June 
 30). A different report date, if applicable, may be selected by checking 
 the Specify date Y/N field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the Print button located at the bottom of the form. Once the 
 report has been submitted to the task queue, you may leave this application 
 or generate other reports. You will receive notification when your report 
 is ready. Reports are saved in file manager under Provincial &gt; Continuing 
 Education.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example of the report generated through this option.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-coned-stutype-report.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:795px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each student, the report will generate information about the student 
 as of the report date. This will consider the student’s <a href="../students/enrolment-internal-transfers.htm">internal 
 transfers</a> to determine the student’s continuing education type and 
 attendance type on the count date.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The continuing education/summer school ‘short’ name is listed along 
 with the student’s start and end date at the school. The student’s continuing 
 education student type at the CE/summer school is listed.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Compare that continuing education student type to the student’s day 
 school attendance type provided on the report. If the student is enrolled 
 in more than one day school on the report date, it will use the school 
 that was the Main School/ Holder of the OSR on that date.  These 
 are the possible attendance types:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>FT (Full-time)</p>
<p>PT (Part-time)</p>
<p>IS (Independent study – part-time)</p>
<p>SAL (Supervised Alternative Learning – part-time)</p>
<p>1-4 (Full days on alternate day schedule 1, 2, 3, or 4)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, a student whose attendance type at a day school shows FT 
 (full-time), should have a Con. Ed. Student type of “Also attends day 
 school (Full-time)”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any corrections to a student’s continuing education student type will 
 need to be made directly in the student’s record.</p>
