<h1>Scheduling next year &gt; Schedule classes - Overview</h1>
<p>The Scheduling next year &gt; Schedule classes option is where you’ll 
 find all the tools to help schedule the classes into the best placements. 
 A placement is the assignment of a specific pattern for the semester/term 
 and day period. For example, if a class has the semester/term set called 
 &#39;Single semester&#39; and the day/period set called &#39;Single period&#39;, the possible 
 placements are semester 1 period 1; semester 1 period 2; semester 2 period 
 1; semester 2 period 2, etc.  Since <a href="../setup/setup-class-sem-term-day-pd.htm">set 
 and pattern names are used defined</a>, they should use terminology that 
 is familiar to the school (e.g. the pattern called period 1 in one school 
 might be called Block A in another school).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The best placement for a class is:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>the placement with the lowest number of student of conflicts AND</li>
	<li>the teacher and room are available in that placement (e.g. the 
	 teacher is not teaching another class and the room is not occupied 
	 with another class).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If more than 1 placement has the fewest conflicts, the placement with 
 the lowest balance is considered the ‘best’.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before deciding the best placement for a class, the application will 
 analyze the impact of scheduling the class in every placement. This way 
 it can compare the number of conflicts and balance for each placement 
 to determine the best placement. The ‘# Conflicts’ is the number of student 
 conflicts that will be generated if the class is scheduled in that placement. 
  The ‘# Balance’ is the theoretical number of students who will be 
 scheduled into classes in that placement (actual class sizes are not known 
 at this step, so if 100 students have requested a course and there are 
 4 classes, theoretically each class will have a balance of 25 students). 
 The balance sums the theoretical number of students in classes that are 
 at the same grade level as this class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Typically, a school will schedule a small group of classes, and then 
 will run the <a href="sched-load-students.htm">Load students</a> process 
 then <a href="sched-az-conflicts.htm">Analyze conflicts</a>. Once satisfied 
 with the results, these steps are repeated for another group of classes. 
 Refer to the <a href="sched-overview.htm">secondary scheduling overview</a> 
 for suggested steps to schedule the school. There are different approaches 
 to the determining which groups of classes to schedule first.  Since 
 every school is different, there is no right or wrong order.  We 
 recommend that classes with the most restrictions be scheduled first. 
 Restrictions may be due to rooms (only 1 gym and it is used every period). 
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The tools to schedule classes for next year are as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Master builder - Automatic</span>: 
	  Use <a href="sched-master-builder-auto.htm">Scheduling next 
	 year &gt; Schedule classes &gt; Master builder - Automatic</a> to 
	 automatically schedule classes.  <br/>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Master builder - Manual</span>: 
	  Use <a href="sched-master-builder-manual.htm">Scheduling next 
	 year &gt; Schedule classes &gt; Master builder - Manual</a> to see 
	 all the information to help you decide where to schedule the class, 
	 including the number of conflicts that would be generated in each 
	 potential placement. Manual placement may highlight a better placement 
	 not available in the automatic mode because the teacher and/or room 
	 were unavailable.<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unscheduled classes</span>:  Run 
	 <a href="sched-unsched-classes.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Schedule 
	 Classes &gt; Unscheduled classes</a> to see if there are any classes 
	 that are not yet scheduled. Students cannot be assigned into these 
	 classes. If classes are found, you may select the class to access 
	 the schedule option which will open <a href="sched-master-builder-manual.htm">Master 
	 builder - Manual</a>, for the class.<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Timetable of a specific group</span>: 
	  Use <a href="sched-tt-specific-group.htm">Scheduling next year 
	 &gt; Schedule classes &gt; Timetable of specific group</a> to see 
	 a master timetable view for a group of classes, including the actual 
	 or theoretical (aka nominal) number of students who will be scheduled 
	 into classes in each period. This will help determine if the periods 
	 are balanced and will help identify if any classes may be overloaded 
	 (after running load students without limiting classes to their maximum 
	 occupancy).<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Available teachers</span>:  <a href="sched-class-available-teachers.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; 
	 Classes &gt; Available teachers</a> to identify what teachers are 
	 available for a specific semester/term/day/period.<br/>
	</li>
	<li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Available rooms</span>:  Use 
	 <a href="sched-class-available-rooms.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; 
	 Classes &gt; Available rooms</a> to identify what rooms are available 
	 for a specific semester/term/day/period.</p></li>
</ol>
