  <p>FUTURE RELEASE</p>
  <p>Overview</p>
  <p>In preparation for recording student attendance, attendance codes are setup. The setup of the attendance codes is generally done during the initial setup of a new board/district or school, and rarely needs to be revisited.</p>
  <p>We strongly suggest that all codes are centrally defined by the board/division to ensure the same meaning for an attendance codes is used in any reporting (e.g. you don’t want different schools using the same attendance code for very different purposes). Schools may be granted view only access to the attendance codes to prevent the addition of their own codes.</p>
  <p>Prior to setting up attendance codes, please read Attendance – Important concepts – Attendance codes and reasons.  </p>
  <p>Attendance is recorded using a list of attendance codes and reasons that may be defined centrally by the board/division or by the school. The attendance code A is reserved for Absent, and P is reserved for Present, but all other letters of the alphabet are user defined. An unlimited number of reasons may be associated with each code to further classify the attendance code. For example, a school might have a L – Late attendance code with 3 reasons: L – Late – Missed bus, L – Late – Slept in, L – Late - Other. Reasons are optional as some schools prefer to enter the reason in the student’s attendance notes.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If a student is absent and you know the reason, then record attendance using the appropriate code and not just Absent. For example, if the student is absent due to an appointment, rather than recording A - Absent, the attendance should be recorded using an alternate attendance code such as M - Medical appointment, or M - Medical appointment – dentist (if reasons are defined).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>We recommend that reasons are not defined for A – Absent so that this code may be used to quickly identify the students with unexplained absences.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, the attendance information needs to be summarized in a manner other than based on the A to Z attendance codes entered for the students. For example, you may just want to know how many times the student was absent from school considering all the different codes. Each attendance code has 2 settings that help summarize attendance information.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>1. Every code has an official setting that indicates whether it is considered Absent, Present, Late, Suspended, or Grant day (e.g. unexpected school closure).</p>
  <p>2. Every code also has a classroom setting that indicates whether the student is expected to show up in the classroom. If the student is not expected to show up to the classroom, there are 2 options: absent (student is absent from school) or excused (student is excused from class because they are elsewhere attending a school related activity).</p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <p>A – Absent Official = Absent Classroom = Absent</p>
  <p>F – Field trip Official = Present Classroom = Excused</p>
  <p>I – Ill Official = Absent Classroom = Absent</p>
  <p>L – Late Official = Late Classroom = Present</p>
  <p>M – Medical Official = Absent Classroom = Absent</p>
  <p>P – Present Official = Present Classroom = Present</p>
  <p>T – Team event Official = Present Classroom = Excused</p>
  <p>W – With reason Official = Absent Classroom = Absent</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>From the examples above, you can see that there are 3 different ways to view the student’s attendance depending on whether you want to see the school codes, the official codes or the classroom codes.</p>
  <p>The setup area for attendance codes is used in the following situations:</p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:16px;">• New attendance codes need to be added.</span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:16px;">• New reasons need to be added to existing attendance codes.</span></p>
  <p><span style="margin-left:16px;">• An existing attendance code needs to be changed.</span></p>
  <p>Access to the setup of attendance codes is available from 2 locations:</p>
  <p>Select the Menu icon in the left corner, then select either Attendance, then Setup or select Setup, then Attendance.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This will take you to the attendance setup section where you will find the Attendance codes card.</p>
  <p>  </p>
  <p>Select the GO button on the card to access the setup of the attendance codes.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Attendance codes</p>
  <p>Here is an example of the attendance codes table.  It will be sorted in alphabetic order based on the letter (A to Z) assigned to the code.</p>
  <p>Each attendance code has a number of fields that define the purpose and interpretation of the code.  See Attendance code fields for information on each field. The centrally defined column will show Yes if the code’s definition is defined by the board/division, and therefore the code may not be edited by the school.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Adding a new attendance code</p>
  <p>Use the Add icon in the attendance codes tool bar to define a new attendance code, using a letter that is not  already presented in the list of codes.</p>
  <p>Then proceed to enter the fields required to define the new attendance code. Please see Attendance code fields for information on each field.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Editing an attendance code</p>
  <p>Select the attendance code from the list to access the Edit option.  Schools may not edit codes that have Yes in the centrally defined column.</p>
  <p>Click edit and make any changes that you want. While editing an attendance code, you can navigate to the next or previous code in the list using the NEXT CODE and PREVIOUS CODE buttons at the bottom of page. When you click the buttons at the bottom of the page any edits will be saved automatically.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Details</p>
  <p>Select a code to see the Details option.  The details option will show the fields defined for the attendance code.  Here is an example:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Removing an attendance code</p>
  <p>You cannot remove an attendance code that has been assigned to any student during the current school year .  If you need to remove a code, select the code from the list to access the Edit option and then click the Discard icon.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Attendance code fields</p>
  <p>When a code is added or edited, the following fields are available to setup the attendance code:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Letter: A letter (A to Z) is defined for the code. This letter will be used in areas of the application where the attendance is condensed such that the title cannot be displayed. The letter A is reserved for Absent and the letter P is reserved for present. If adding a new code, the new code must use a letter that is not yet defined. If editing an existing code, the letter may be changed only if the existing letter has not yet been used this school year.</p>
  <p>Official: Select the most appropriate official definition for this code from the following options: Absent, Present, Late, Suspended, or Grant day (unexpected school closure). This definition is used when the attendance information is summarized using the official definition rather than the A to Z attendance codes. For example, you may just want to know how many times the student was absent from school considering all the different codes.</p>
  <p>Classroom: Select the most appropriate classroom definition for this code from the following options: Absent, Excused, or Present. Absent is used when the code represents that the student is absent from school for non-school related reasons (e.g. student is sick or on vacation). Excused is used when the code represents that the student is considered present for school but is not expected to show up to the classroom because of a school-related activity (e.g. field trip, sport team game, music performance). This definition is used when the attendance information is summarized using the classroom definition rather than the A to Z attendance codes. For example, you may want to know how much time the student was not in the classroom (missing class lessons). The sum of the codes defined as absent or excused represent the total number of times the student was not in the classroom.</p>
  <p>English title: The title, in English, to clarify the purpose of the attendance code. E.g. the code M might have the title Medical.</p>
  <p>French title: The title, in French, to clarify the purpose of the attendance code. This is optional.</p>
  <p>Reasons: An unlimited number of reasons may be associated with each code to further classify the attendance code. For example, a school might have a L – Late attendance code with 3 reasons: L – Late – Missed bus, L – Late – Slept in, L – Late - Other. Reasons are optional as some schools prefer to enter the reason in the student’s attendance notes.  </p>
  <p>From the Reasons card, use the Add icon in the tool bar to add a new reason, or select a previously defined reason if edits are required.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Whether adding or editing the reason, there are 3 fields: an English and French title to describe the reason, and an optional identifier. The identifier can be up to 5 characters in length. Identifiers may be useful for external data analysis.</p>
  <p>A reason may be removed using the Discard icon on the edit reason tool bar. If the reason has been assigned to anyone this year, it may not be removed .</p>
  <p>Centrally defined codes can be assigned to specific schools</p>
  <p>If adding/editing attendance codes centrally from the board/division, the Selected schools card will appear to provide control over which schools will have this attendance code. The list will show the schools that currently have access to this code.  </p>
  <p>  </p>
  <p>Use the Add school icon to add schools to this list. If the new school already has a code defined for that letter, a dialogue will be presented to allow you to decide whether or not the school’s existing code will be replaced with the centrally defined code.</p>
  <p>If a school is to be removed from the list of selected schools, check the box to the left of the school to enable the Discard icon. When the Discard icon is selected, all the checked schools will be removed from the list.</p>
  <p>Printing/exporting attendance codes.</p>
  <p>From the Attendance codes card, select the More menu to access the options to print or export the list of codes.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Attendance codes business rules (internal documentation only)</p>
  <p>1. A and P codes may not be edited (however, we do allow reasons to be added – do we want to remove this functionality).</p>
  <p>2. Codes defined by central office are assigned to schools.  These schools cannot edit these codes (row click only provides access to Details).</p>
  <p>3. Add icon in tool bar should be disabled if all letters of alphabet are already assigned to codes.  Tool tip – All letters already defined.</p>
  <p>4. Codes A and P cannot be removed.</p>
  <p>5. Code cannot be removed if it has been assigned to any student during the current school year.  . I think the icon should be disabled if unable to delete.  Tool tip could then say ‘Unable to discard because it is assigned to students’.</p>
  <p>6. Adding or editing a code, the drop down list of available codes must exclude A, P and any letters already assigned to codes.</p>
  <p>7. Adding or editing a code, either an English or a French title must be defined but both are not required. (e.g. you can have just a French title).</p>
  <p>8. Adding/editing a code centrally, provide a warning if no schools are assigned to the code.  E.g. There are no schools associated with this Attendance code. SAVE WITHOUT SCHOOLS or EDIT CODE</p>
  <p>9. If a new code is centrally added by the board/division, or if a school is added to the list of schools assigned to that code, it will check to see if  any schools already have that code defined for their own purposes. If so, a dialogue will be generated.  </p>
  <p>This code is already is use at:  </p>
  <p>     School 1</p>
  <p>     School 2 etc</p>
  <p>The school’s attendance code can be updated to match this centrally defined code, or the school can be excluded from the selected schools(school code is not updated).</p>
  <p>UPDATE SCHOOL CODE       DON’T UPDATE SCHOOL  </p>
  <p>10. Bottom tool bar:  NEXT CODE PREVIOUS CODE and DONE will save edits automatically. NEXT/PREVIOUS disabled if last/first code in table.</p>
  <p>11. Reasons are optional.</p>
  <p>12. No limit to the number of reasons per code.</p>
  <p>13. Reasons must have either an English or a French title. Identifier is optional (5 characters max – does not need to be unique). Titles don’t need to be unique either (e.g. in windows I could add 2 reasons with the same title and identifier).</p>
  <p>14. Reasons may not be removed if the reason has been assigned to anyone this year. I think the icon should be disabled if unable to delete. Tool tip could then say ‘Unable to discard because it is assigned to students’.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Later (internal documentation only)</p>
  <p>Chad – do not put this in the manual. I think we may be ok to omit this for a long time, now that we are rewording the options.</p>
