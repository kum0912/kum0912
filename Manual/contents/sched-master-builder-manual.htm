<h1>Scheduling next year &gt; Schedule classes &gt; Master builder - Manual</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Master builder – Manual tool provides info about a class to help 
 you decide the best placement (location) to schedule the class. A placement 
 defines when the class is taught using the semester/term and day/period 
 patterns defined by the school.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This same info is used in the Master builder – Automatic tool, which 
 is typically used first to automatically schedule a group of classes. 
  The ‘manual’ scheduling of classes, through this tool, is typically 
 used for these situations:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Master builder – Automatic generated a report of unscheduled classes 
	 (classes where there is no placement available where both the teacher 
	 and room are available).</li>
	<li>Analyzing conflicts shows a class that is not well scheduled (course 
	 has lots of conflicts and/or a class has low student enrolment). Note: 
	 overloaded classes are a problem, however they are scheduled into 
	 a good placement (e.g. don’t try to re-schedule these classes).  The 
	 class sections with low enrolment are poorly scheduled.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To help understand how this scheduling tool works, a quick examination 
 of the information presented in the Master builder – Manual tool may be 
 beneficial. For each class, the semester/term patterns are listed in columns, 
 and the day/period patterns are in rows. Each intersection of a semester/term 
 column and day/period row represents one possible placement in the master 
 timetable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:997px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Master builder – Manual mode presents the info and lets you decide 
 where to schedule the class. As explained later, you can select (click) 
 any placement to access the tools to schedule the class into that placement, 
 or to look at available teachers and rooms in that placement. It will 
 also show the students who would have conflicts if the class were scheduled 
 in that placement.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Icons appear when the teacher and/or room are not available.  Hover 
 over the icon to see a tool tip explaining the icon, including info about 
 why the teacher or room are unavailable.  Here are some example icons 
 and tool tips.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-main1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1037px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you prefer to always show the classes without having to use the tooltips, 
 use the icon in the tool bar to toggle between showing and hiding the 
 classes beside each icon. This first example below shows the classes hidden:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-main2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:654px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This shows the classes beside the icons.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-main3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:659px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A legend will appear below the grid, as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-main4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:778px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the class is currently scheduled in a placement, that current placement 
 will be identified with a dark background colour. A class has a current 
 placement if it has both a semester/term pattern and a day/period pattern.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the class is not scheduled in the ‘best’ placement, that best placement 
 will be identified with a lighter background colour. The best placement 
 for a class is the placement with the lowest # of conflicts and no icons 
 appear (e.g. teacher and room are available in that placement). If more 
 than 1 placement has the fewest conflicts, the placement with the lowest 
 balance is considered the ‘best’.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every placement will include # Conflicts / # Balance.  The ‘# Conflicts’ 
 is the number of student conflicts that will be generated if the class 
 is scheduled in that placement.  The ‘# Balance’ is the theoretical 
 number of students who will be scheduled into classes in that placement 
 (actual class sizes are not known at this step, so if 100 students have 
 requested a course and there are 4 classes, theoretically each class will 
 have a balance of 25 students). The balance sums the theoretical number 
 of students in classes that are at the same grade level as this class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> To use Master builder – manual, follow these steps for the class to 
 be scheduled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Choose Scheduling next year &gt; Scheduling 
 classes.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:203px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select GO on the Master builder - Manual card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first class will be automatically presented, but any class may be 
 selected from the Class field. </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-main5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:668px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sometimes there are classes already scheduled by the school such that 
 they cannot be analyzed using Master builder – manual.  If one of 
 these classes are selected, a message will appear reminding you why it 
 may not be scheduled:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Classes is scheduled by the school using the special schedule option 
	 in the setup of the class.  Patterns are needed for the scheduling 
	 tools and these classes do not have patterns.</li>
	<li>Class is scheduled manually using more than 1 schedule (sometimes 
	 called multiple occurrences). This is used in special situations, 
	 typically when a school has built the timetable by hand (e.g. a full 
	 year class that is taught in different periods in each semester).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">2. Analyze the info  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Look at the number of conflicts in each possible placement. Since the 
 automatic scheduling tools have constraints, the ‘current’ or ‘best’ placement 
 may not necessarily be the best placement to reduce student conflicts. 
  If there is a placement that has a significantly lower number of 
 student conflicts, use the info to determine if there is a way to make 
 that placement work for this class.  Some things that may be considered:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Assigning a different teacher or room, if the teacher or room are 
	 not available in the desired placement</li>
	<li>Unlocking the semester/term and/or day/period pattern to allow 
	 the class to be scheduled into a placement with a lower number of 
	 conflicts.  To do this, select the lock icon beside the pattern. 
	   </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>As you analyze this info, remember to consider teacher constraints with 
 respect to the number of periods they may teach each day, and whether 
 a lunch period is required.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also consider the class info located above the grid, as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-main6.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1049px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;"># of sections</span> 
 represents the # of classes of this course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Student requests</span> 
 is the number of students who have this course as one of their preferred 
 course selections.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Residual conflicts</span> 
 are conflicts that exist prior to scheduling this class. No matter where 
 this class is scheduled, these conflicts will exist because they are conflicts 
 with other courses these students have requested.  It shows the # 
 of single conflicts / # of multiple conflicts.  If this number is 
 high, it might be time to re-analyze the entire school schedule by running 
 load students and then analyzing conflicts to see if there are some other 
 classes that should be rescheduled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">3. Change the class schedule/teacher/room, 
 if needed</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select any of the available placements (cells in the grid) to access 
 the scheduling tools.  If a pattern is locked, selecting a placement 
 that is outside a locked pattern constraint will generate a warning message. 
 For example, selecting a semester 2 placement when the class is locked 
 into a semester 1 pattern will show this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-main7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:474px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-main8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1068px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once a placement is selected, the class info above the grid will be 
 collapsed and the Scheduling tools card will appear as shown above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the selected placement has student conflicts, a student conflicts 
 card will also appear showing the students with conflicts, for informational 
 purposes only.  Conflict resolution for individual students is done 
 after all the scheduling is done.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-main9.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:332px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The scheduling tools card has 3 distinct areas.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-main10.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:421px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Schedule class</span>: 
 This is where you can check the box to schedule the class in the selected 
 placement. You may also lock/unlock the semester/term and day/period here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Teacher</span>: If 
 no teacher is assigned to the class, this section is expanded and the 
 first available teacher in that placement is shown.  Browse the available 
 teachers and use the teacher timetable icon to see that teacher’s timetable. 
  Check the box “Set as new teacher for class” if you want to make 
 this the teacher for the class.   If a teacher was previously 
 assigned to the class, this section is collapsed by default but may be 
 expanded to access other available teachers if necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Room</span>: If no 
 room is assigned to the class, this section is expanded and the first 
 available room in that placement is shown.  Browse the available 
 rooms and use the room timetable icon to see that room’s timetable.  Check 
 the box “Set as new room for class” if you want to make this the room 
 for the class.   If a room was previously assigned to the class, 
 this section is collapsed by default but may be expanded to access other 
 available rooms if necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">4. Save the changes to the class</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When finished with the scheduling tools, remember to select the SAVE 
 button to save changes. If no changes were made, select the X in the tool 
 bar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-manual-main11.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:637px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>5. Load students if classes were scheduled into new placements</h4>
<p>If any classes are assigned into new semester/term/day/period patterns, 
 the students timetables will not be updated. You may continue to use master 
 builder on other classes, but once all classes are done, proceed to step 
 2, Assign students to classes – <a href="sched-load-students.htm">Load 
 students</a>, as illustrated here:</p>
