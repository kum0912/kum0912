<h1>International &amp; Indigenous language elementary program (ILLE)</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify;

<p> </p>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;"></p>
 <p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IILE programs option provides Ontario schools and boards with the 
 ability to generate the official Register of Enrolment in the International 
 &amp; Indigenous Languages Elementary (IILE) Program. This is a classroom-based 
 register used to record enrolment and attendance for day school pupils 
 in Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8 who are enrolled in the IILE program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This register option is available to Ontario boards and schools set 
 up with ‘school operating type’ of continuing education. It is also available 
 to those schools with grade 8 or lower whose <a href="../setup/setup-school-configuration.htm">school 
 configuration</a> is set up such that they also require access to continuing 
 education registers.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The courses must be provided through classroom instruction:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>During the school year</li>
	<li>In the summer</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>IILE courses may be offered:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>After school</li>
	<li>Before school or lunch time</li>
	<li>Integrated extended-day program</li>
	<li>Late-afternoon and evening program</li>
	<li>Weekend</li>
	<li>Summer</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>This register may include pupils enrolled in courses that are in languages 
 other than English/French in grade JK to 8 in a publicly funded elementary 
 school or a private school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Schools and boards should be familiar with the official Ministry enrolment 
 register instructions for continuing education programs. These instructions 
 are updated annually on the Ministry’s site <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html">http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html</a>. 
  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please be familiar with the <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a> option in the student’s record. This 
 will provide detailed information on the enrolment register(s) the student 
 will appear on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Hint: on the FTE and/or ADE card in the 
 student’s record, there’s a Details section that may be expanded to show 
 info on how FTE/ADE is calculated, and how the student’s data impacts 
 the register. IILE classes are reported as ADE.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Set up classes that need to appear on the Register of Enrolment in 
 the International &amp; Indigenous Language Elementary (IILE) Program</h3>
<p>There are no Ministry defined course codes for IILE programs.  A 
 <a href="../setup/setup-class-courses.htm">course</a> will need to exist, 
 using any course code that is appropriate for the board/school. It may 
 be a generic IILE course, or multiple course codes may be created for 
 each international or indigenous language course taught and it may optionally 
 incorporate the grade level of the students taking the course.  A 
 class will need to be created for each unique group of students enrolled 
 in the IILE program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a class is to appear in the International &amp; Indigenous Languages 
 Elementary Program register, it must be set up (<a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Setup 
 &gt; Class info &gt; Classes</a>) as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The language of instruction must be one of the following (Ministry 
	 code must be set up correctly by the board using <a href="../setup/setup-languages-of-instruction.htm">Setup 
	 &gt; Class info &gt; Languages of Instruction</a>). Refer to the Ministry&#39;s 
	 reference tables for the extensive list of LANGUAGE_TYPE values that 
	 are categorized as International or Native. Here are some examples:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">01 = French Creole</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">03 = Albanian</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">04 = Arabic</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">09 = Cayuga</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">10 = Cree</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">OTH = Other</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The course offering type must be set to:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- International &amp; Indigenous Languages 
 Elementary (IILE)</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Set the time of day type to one of the following:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- After School</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Before School/Lunch Time  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Extended School Day</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Later-Afternoon/Evening Program</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Summer</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Weekends</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Enter the most appropriate Delivery and Course delivery type</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-iile-1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:533px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Since funding is based on attendance, make sure that the class 
	 schedule, start and end dates, and period times are accurate. Class 
	 start time will determine whether to use the student’s morning or 
	 afternoon attendance entry to populate this register (start time before 
	 noon will read AM attendance, and a start time after noon will read 
	 from the PM attendance).  If the school has only 2 periods, the 
	 class should be set to either period 1 (attendance will read from 
	 the AM attendance) or period 2 (attendance will read from the PM attendance).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Make sure each student’s add/drop dates are accurate (add date is the 
 first day attending the class, drop date is the first date of non-attendance 
 in the class).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Teachers track classroom attendance</h3>
<p>Teachers are responsible for taking accurate classroom attendance, just 
 like any regular class.  The class schedule, start/end dates, and 
 the school’s calendar will define what dates the teacher is expected to 
 take attendance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Cancelled instructional sessions – Funded cancelled session “C”</h3>
<p>Where an instructional session has been cancelled owing to exceptional 
 circumstances (such as bad weather or an emergency) and the instructor 
 is paid, the session will be recognized for funding purposes. These sessions 
 are included in the total number of sessions recognized for funding. The 
 funded cancelled session must be marked with a “C” on the register and 
 the reason for the cancellation must be recorded. To cancel a funded session, 
 follow these instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Use Attendance &gt; Enter attendance &gt; Group Excursion.  Select 
	 the date and group of students (e.g. all students or a specific class).</li>
	<li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, 
	 scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select 
	 the option select the option c Cancelled.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-iile-2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:525px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Record an attendance note describing the reason for the cancellation.</li>
	<li>Apply (save) the attendance for the group.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: If the “C” session is rescheduled, 
 the instructor should not be paid for the rescheduled session and the 
 rescheduled session must not be included in the total number of sessions 
 recognized for funding purposes. See Rescheduled instructional sessions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Cancelled instructional sessions – Unfunded cancelled session “D”</h3>
<p>Where an instructional session has been cancelled (I.e. the teacher 
 is unavailable) and the instructor is not paid, the session will not be 
 recognized for funding purposes. Do not include this session in the total 
 number of sessions recognized for funding. The unfunded cancelled session 
 must be marked with a “D” on the register and the reason for the cancellation 
 must be recorded. To cancel an unfunded session, follow these instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Use Attendance &gt; Enter attendance &gt; Group Excursion.  Select 
	 the date and group of students (e.g. a specific class).</li>
	<li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, 
	 scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select 
	 the option select the option $ Cancelled Not Funded.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-iile-3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:519px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: If the “D” session is rescheduled, 
 the instructor should be paid for the rescheduled session and the rescheduled 
 session must be included in the total number of sessions recognized for 
 funding purposes.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Rescheduled sessions  </h3>
<p>If a new session is to be added to the class, typically the class end 
 date is extended to accommodate the extra session. This is done using 
 <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Setup &gt; Class info &gt; 
 Classes</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the rescheduled session is due to a session that is given the code 
 “C” (funded cancelled session), the instructor should not be paid for 
 the rescheduled session and the rescheduled session must not be included 
 in the total number of sessions recognized for funding purposes. To reschedule 
 a session, and have it not appear in the register, follow these instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Use <a href="../attendance/att-enter-groupex.htm">Attendance &gt; 
	 Enter attendance &gt; Group/excursion</a>.  Select the date and 
	 group of students (e.g. All students or a specific class).</li>
	<li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, 
	 scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select 
	 the option select the option ^ Non-instructional Day</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-iile-4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:574px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Record an attendance note describing the reason the class is removed 
	 from the register (e.g. rescheduled session for the mm/yyyy funded 
	 cancelled session due to weather).</li>
	<li>Apply (save) the attendance for the group.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Generate the Register of Enrolment in the International &amp; Indigenous 
 Languages Elementary (IILE) Program</h2>
<p>To access the register, select Ontario reporting &gt; Enrolment registers 
 &gt; IILE programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-iile-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:201px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The form will look like this:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-iile-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:706px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The list of classes will default any classes that are set up to appear 
 on this register. You may limit the classes using the filters, or select 
 an individual or range of classes to print.  A separate register 
 is generated for each selected class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the Print button located at the bottom of the form. Once the 
 report has been submitted to the task queue, you may leave this application 
 or generate other reports. You will receive notification when your report 
 is ready. Reports are saved in <a href="../setup/setup-file-manager.htm">file 
 manager</a> under Provincial &gt; Enrolment registers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Hint: See previously created registers by 
 selecting the folder icon to open file manager at this location.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The info generated on the register may also be exported in a CSV file 
 by checking the option shown below. The CSV file will be generated along 
 with the register report, as part of the submission to the task queue. 
   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-course-grant-export.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:280px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example of the register report:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-iile-report.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:888px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The top of the report will include the register name, school year, class 
 (course code &amp; section letter and course title).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-iile-report-top.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:616px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each pupil in the class, it will include the following info from 
 the student’s record (in the Personal area):</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-iile-report1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:808px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Day school pupil’ column is populated with either FT (full-time), 
 PT (part-time) or blank (student is not a day school pupil) based on the 
 student’s field called ‘Con. Ed. Student type’ (in student record under 
 <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment &gt; 
 Enrolment register info</a>).  All pupils of the board are funded 
 and their attendance sessions are included in the non-credit ADE calculations, 
 so this column may be ignored (it will be blank for elementary schools 
 offering IILE since these students don’t have a Con. Ed. Student Type).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>FT appears if the student’s Con. Ed. Student Type is one of the following 
 types:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Full-time)</li>
	<li>Full-Time Day School (exclude from Register totals)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>PT appears if the student’s Con. Ed. Student Type is one of the following 
 types:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Part-time)</li>
	<li>Part-time taking same course(s) in day school (exclude from register 
	 totals).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Blank appears if the student’s Con. Ed. Student Type is:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Only Attends Con. Ed. School</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Pupil’s board resident status’ column will show OP if the student 
 is considered an Other Pupil (OP). OP will appear if the board defined 
 student board residence status does not use ministry code 01, 06, 07, 
 or 09. If a student is an “Other Pupil”, their sessions will not be recognized 
 for funding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For students also attending day school, the ‘Day School Address’ column 
 will use the student’s origin school as recorded in the student’s record 
 in <a href="../students/enrolment-students.htm">Enrolment &gt; Student 
 enrolment</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To the right of the student info it will show the student’s attendance 
 at sessions. This info is based on the entry of attendance by the teachers. 
 The dates are based on the setup of the class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-iile-report2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:581px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each date, a blank will appear if the student is present.  If 
 the student was not present at the session, one of the following 4 codes 
 will appear:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A      Pupil absence from a session</p>
<p>—     Late admission or early withdrawal (based 
 on the student’s class add/drop dates)</p>
<p>C       Funded cancelled session</p>
<p>D       Unfunded cancelled session</p>
<p> </p>
<p>* if the student is absent 3 or more consecutive sessions, these absences 
 are not funded (they are excluded from total). Cancelled sessions (“C” 
 or “D”) do not ‘break’ the consecutive absent count.  For example, 
 if a student had 5 consecutive absences in a row (Sept 26 to Oct 15), 
 as well as 3 consecutive absences on Jan 30, Feb 6 and Feb 11. The cancelled 
 session on Feb 4 does not count as a consecutive absence, but it also 
 does not break the count of consecutive absences. Therefore, if there 
 was a possible 40 sessions that the student could attend, the school will 
 receive funding for 32 sessions (40 - 5 - 3 = 32).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the student details page, a summary page is included with an area 
 for the principal to certify the register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-iile-report3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:618px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Hours per session’ is based on the daily average minutes of instruction 
 set up for the class (using <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Setup 
 &gt; Class info &gt; Classes</a>). This may be based on period times, 
 or it may be manually entered directly into the daily average minutes 
 of instruction field. The minutes will be converted to hours on this register.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Funding - OnSIS reporting of classes on the Continuing Education Registers</h3>
<p>All full and part-time taking IILE courses are eligible for funding. 
 The FT and PT pupils who enrolled and attended sessions are included in 
 the totals used to calculate funding. The funding allocation is based 
 upon the total number of hours of funded classroom instruction. IILE funding 
 is capped as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>During the school year at 2.5 hours of classroom instruction per 
	 week per language; and  </li>
	<li>During the summer at 2.5 hours of classroom instruction per day 
	 per language.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>When the board class average is 23 or greater, maximum funding is generated 
 per instructional hour. Where the average size of an international languages 
 class is less than 23, the rate per classroom hour is reduced by $1 for 
 every pupil less than 23.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Funding is based on the information submitted to OnSIS.  Regular 
 schools requiring continuing education registers should refer to <a href="on-onsis-ille-lit-num-info.htm">OnSIS 
 &gt; Continuing education for day school &gt; IILE/Literacy &amp; numeracy</a>). 
  Continuing education schools should refer to <a href="on-onsis-coned-night-school.htm">OnSIS 
 &gt; Night/continuing education school &gt; ConEd/Night school info</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the Ministry’s instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Elemental data is collected once a year 
 on August 31 for the entire school year (September-August). Submit data 
 through the Continuing Education and/or Summer School submissions (School 
 Special Condition Type “N – Continuing Education” or “8 – Summer”) even 
 if the IILE course is offered in a regular elementary day school (I.e. 
 integrated extended day program).</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">As data is collected in aggregate, the pupil’s 
 OEN is not required. Course Offering Type will not be collected for IILE 
 programs.  </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">The following information must be reported 
 by international or Indigenous language:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Total Number of Classes,  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Total Number of Instructors,</p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Total Number of Students, and  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Total Number of Hours</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Number of Classes must be reported to OnSIS 
 by the time of day the classes were offered, using the following categories:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">1. After School,  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">2. Before School or Lunch time  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">3. Integrated Extended-Day Program 
	  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">4. Late-Afternoon and Evening Program 
	  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">5. Weekend  </p></li>
	<li><span style="font-style: italic;">6. Summer</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>ADE calculations for classes on the Continuing Education Credit Courses 
 registers</h3>
<p>The calculation of the average daily enrolment (ADE) is calculated as 
 follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ADE = # of sessions recognized for funding 
 x hours per session / 950</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other reports</h2>
<p>Continuing education schools may also want to consider running these 
 options:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="on-coned-coned-ade.htm">Ontario 
 reporting &gt; Continuing education &gt; Continuing education ADE</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This generates the OnSIS continuing education enrolment detail and summary 
 report showing average daily enrolment (ADE) info for continuing education 
 or summer school students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="on-ereg-course-list-grant.htm">Ontario 
 reporting &gt; Enrolment registers &gt; Course lists for grant purposes</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This generates class by class details of each register, showing total 
 ADE by register and for the school/board.</p>
