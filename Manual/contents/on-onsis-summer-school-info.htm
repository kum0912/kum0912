<h1>OnSIS &gt; Summer school &gt; Summer school info</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Summer school info option appears for schools that are configured 
 as summer schools. This configuration is done using Setup &gt; School 
 &gt; Configuration. This option is used to report all classes that appear 
 on the continuing education registers that may apply to summer schools:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><a href="on-enreg-summer.htm">Summer School Register</a></li>
	<li><a href="on-ereg-corr-self-study.htm">Register of Enrolment in 
	 Correspondence/Self-Study/E-Learning Courses</a></li>
	<li><a href="on-ereg-ille.htm">Register of Enrolment in the International 
	 &amp; Indigenous Languages Elementary (IILE) Program</a></li>
	<li><a href="on-enreg-lit-numeracy.htm">Register of Enrolment in the 
	 Literacy and Numeracy Program</a></li>
	<li><a href="on-ereg-adult-indig-lang-inst.htm">Register of Enrolment 
	 in Adult Indigenous Language Instruction</a></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>This option is used to create batch files, using the CREATE button. 
 The batch file is uploaded to OnSIS through the OnSIS web site.  Once 
 OnSIS processes the batch file, a results file is created. The results 
 file is downloaded from OnSIS and is then processed using the PROCESS 
 RESULTS button.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This section describes the creation of the batch files. See the OnSIS 
 <a href="on-onsis-important-concepts.htm">Important concepts</a> section 
 for info on <a href="on-onsis-important-concepts.htm#Updating_data">Updating 
 data in OnSIS using the ‘Create/Upload/Process’ cycle</a>.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are 3 OnSIS batch files available for summer schools. Follow the 
 links below for the file specifications:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="#Student_class_enrolment_batch_file_">Student class enrolment</a></p>
<p><a href="#Non-credit_ADE_Other">Non-credit ADE – Other programs</a></p>
<p><a href="#Non-Credit_ADE_IILE">Non-credit ADE – International &amp; 
 Indigenous Language Elementary (IILE)</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>See the enrolment register links above for detailed info on how to set 
 up classes and enter data for students on this register. This also explains 
 how ADE is calculated.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The course offering type defined for the class determines which batch 
 file option applies to those students, as explained in this chart. Use 
 the batch file links for detailed file specifications.</p>

<p>Select the CREATE button on the Summer school info card to see this 
 form:</p>
<p> </p>

<p>  </p>
<p>The OnSIS batch file options are detailed below. Prior to selecting 
 the CREATE BATCH FILE option, determine whether other options on the form 
 should be selected.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Purge</span>:  Y/N 
 field. See <a href="on-onsis-important-concepts.htm#Purge_check_boxes">Important 
 concepts – Purge check boxes</a> for more info.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Save results to CSV 
 file (aka Also create CSV file)</span>: Y/N field. If set to Yes, the 
 CREATE BATCH FILE option will create the requested batch file and the 
 contents of the batch file will also appear in a comma delimited file 
 (same file name as the XML batch file but with a CSV extension). Some 
 boards/schools generate these csv files to perform data analysis on the 
 information sent to OnSIS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Adult day school – 
 Exclude attendance totals</span>: Y/N field. Report card attendance data 
 is reported to OnSIS for publicly funded secondary schools. If this summer 
 school is considered an adult day school, then set this option to Y. If 
 this is set to Yes, the following information is omitted from the OnSIS 
 batch file: Total classes, Classes Missed, Times Late, IEP and ESL/ELD 
 info.  </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Student_class_enrolment_batch_file_" id="Student_class_enrolment_batch_file_"></a>Student 
 class enrolment batch file</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>OnSIS is collecting enrolment information about the students enrolled 
 in summer schools,  along with information regarding any credits attempted/earned 
 during the academic school year.   Failed courses in the students&#39; transcript 
 are collected by OnSIS, along with withdrawn courses that are entered 
 in the transcript as per full disclosure requirements. Any course not 
 completed where the student did attend class, and therefore an ADE was 
 generated will also be included in the OnSIS submission (if the ADE was 
 generated within the submission period)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The setup of the school and the student’s timetables needs to be accurate 
 for this batch file. Check the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Calendar start and end dates of each semester/term are accurate 
	 (Setup &gt; School &gt; Calendar).</li>
	<li>Classes have accurate schedules (semester/term/day/period info) 
	 and start/end dates (Setup &gt; Class info &gt; Classes).</li>
	<li>Students timetables are accurate (student’s record &gt; Class info 
	 &gt; Timetable). The timetable should include all of the student’s 
	 classes. The date the student started each class, and if applicable, 
	 the date they withdrew from a class should be accurate. Hint: From 
	 the student’s record, us the Class info &gt; Classes option to see 
	 the student’s start/end dates for each class.  If they need editing, 
	 from the timetable option, use the More icon to access the Register 
	 option (register of add/drop dates).</li>
	<li>Students should have a graduation requirement assigned (student’s 
	 record &gt; Achievement &gt; Graduation requirements). This is used 
	 to determine whether a completed course is compulsory for graduation.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The students&#39; transcripts (completed courses) must be updated with the 
 final marks and credits earned (see <a href="../achievement/add-completed-courses.htm">Add 
 completed courses</a> for info on this process). The info in the student’s 
 completed courses (student 
 record &gt; Achievement &gt; Completed courses) is where the final 
 marks and earned credit information is recorded for use in this file.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This batch file will create the Student class enrolment batch file just 
 like any regular secondary school, however it does not include the &#39;other 
 credit&#39; fields that are included in regular school batch files. Follow 
 the link below for detailed file specifications from the School info section 
 for regular schools.</p>
