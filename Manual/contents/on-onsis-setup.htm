<h1>OnSIS &gt; Submission period &gt; Setup</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each submission period includes a setup card. This card will provide 
 quick access to the file manager location where the OnSIS extracts (if 
 applicable), batch files, and results files are stored for the submission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The setup may also contain options that may influence the OnSIS batch 
 files, so it is good practice to check this option before starting any 
 new submission period. If applicable, these setup options will appear 
 below the file manager locations:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="#Homeroom_Aliases_">Homeroom Aliases</a></p>
<p><a href="#Grade_10_to_12_Designation_Types_">Grade 10 to 12 Designation 
 Types</a></p>
<p><a href="#Campus_numbers_">Campus Numbers</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Choose OnSIS &gt; (submission period) &gt; Setup and select the GO button 
 to access the setup options for the submission period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-onsis-setup-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:204px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Setup form will be customized according to the submission period 
 selected.  Some submission periods will only contain the file manager 
 links, and others may contain setup options as explained below.  Here 
 is an example of the form showing the file manager links and the ‘Grade 
 10 to 12 Designation Types’ setup option:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-onsis-setup-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:728px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The file manager locations are listed at the top of the setup form. 
 Select any of the folder icons to quickly access those files in file manager.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-onsis-setup-main-top.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:598px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extract 
 files</span>: these are the CSV files that come from OnSIS. They provide 
 info about the state of the OnSIS data. If a submission period does not 
 require extracts, this location will not appear.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Batch files</span>: 
  these are the XML files that the SIS creates. They provide add/update 
 instructions so that OnSIS can update their data to match the data in 
 the SIS. These files are created by the SIS and are uploaded to OnSIS 
 for processing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Results 
 files</span>: these are OUT files that OnSIS creates when the batch files 
 are processed. They provide info about whether the file is processed successfully 
 or with errors/warnings. These files are downloaded from OnSIS and then 
 processed by the SIS to create an easy to read PDF file of the results.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If applicable, there will be a subheader for each setup option that 
 applies to the submission period.  Here are the possible setup options:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Homeroom_Aliases_" id="Homeroom_Aliases_"></a>Homeroom Aliases</h3>
<p>This setup option appears for the October, March and June Elementary 
 School submission periods.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>OnSIS collects each elementary student’s homeroom in a field called 
 CLASS_CODE. This setup option provides a way for a school to report a 
 different class code to OnSIS than the class code used by the school. 
 For example, if a school splits the students in homeroom 4/5 into 2 distinct 
 homerooms (such as 4/5C for the students taking core French and the 4/5I 
 for the students taking immersion French), this setup will allow all 20 
 students in the homeroom to be reported to OnSIS as one class called 4/5. 
  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-onsis-setup-homeroom.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:730px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The list of homerooms in the school will appear in the Homeroom column. 
 The second column will also show homerooms, but this ‘OnSIS homeroom’ 
 column may be edited so that the student’s homeroom reported to OnSIS 
 will use something else.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This homeroom aliases setup will be saved and used for all applicable 
 submission periods. This will ensure that the same class groupings are 
 used throughout the school year.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style="color: #000000;"><a name="Grade_10_to_12_Designation_Types_" id="Grade_10_to_12_Designation_Types_" style="color: #000000;">Grade 10 to 12 
 Designation Types</a></h3>
<p>This setup option appears for the October, March and June Secondary 
 School submission periods.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/on-onsis-setup-10-12-designation.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:599px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since some schools may assign grades to students using different methods, 
 OnSIS collects information about how a grade 10 to 12 student’s grade 
 is assigned, in a field called GRADE_DESIGNATION_TYPE in the batch files. 
  There are 3 possible methods that the Ministry considers appropriate 
 for determining a student’s grade:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Years of 
 attendance</span>:  This designation type describes schools where 
 the student’s grade is based on the number of years the student has attended 
 high school (e.g. grade is automatically advanced regardless of the student&#39;s 
 academic success).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accumulated 
 credits</span>: This designation type describes schools where the student’s 
 grade is based on the credits earned.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Principal 
 designation</span>: This designation type describes schools where the 
 principal designates what grade is most appropriate for the students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most schools designate the grade based on years of attendance. This 
 may be changed by selecting the drop down arrow to select from the 3 possible 
 types. Grade 12 students can have different designations based on credit 
 counts. C<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">redit counts are based on 
 the accumulation of credits at the end of the school year.</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"> Timetable and transcript credits 
 are totaled for the grade 12 M, and U courses.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This grade designation setup will be saved and used for all applicable 
 submission periods. This will ensure that the same designation type is 
 used throughout the school year.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Campus_numbers_" id="Campus_numbers_"></a>Campus numbers</h3>
<p>This setup option appears for the following submission periods:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Continuing education for day school (IILE/Literacy &amp; numercy)</li>
	<li>Night/continuing education school</li>
	<li>Summer school</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>CAMPUS_NUMBER is an optional field in the OnSIS batch files for the 
 students in the above submission periods.  This feature was provided 
 by OnSIS to help continuing education schools with multiple campuses who 
 report to OnSIS using one school. It allows the school to identify which 
 campus/site the student attended. The field is for the school use only. 
 The OnSIS campus number field will accept numbers or letters, but not 
 spaces.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To populate the campus number in the batch file, the students must be 
 identified as attending a specific campus by following these steps:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Determine which of the 4 possible defined characters will be used 
	 for all students to identify the campus. In this example, we’ll use 
	 defined character 3.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Students will need to have an entry in defined character 3. The 
	 entry must be the same for all students at the campus. In this example, 
	 we’ll use the value M in defined character 3 for students attending 
	 St. Mary’s campus, and the value W for the students attending Willowcreek 
	 campus. Defined characters are assigned from the student’s record 
	 using Enrolment &gt; Flags.  Once assigned, the defined character 
	 will appear in the profile area of the student’s record as shown here:<br/>
	</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img src="assets/images/on-onsis-setup-campus.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:437px;" border="0"/><br/>
</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>From the Setup option in the OnSIS submission, define the campus 
	 numbers to be included in the OnSIS batch files.  Use the Add 
	 icon in the Campus Numbers card to define the number to be sent.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-onsis-setup-campus1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:591px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Specify the number to be reported to OnSIS 
 (it can be letters or numbers, but spaces are not allowed). Then indicate 
 which of the 4 defined characters is used for identifying the campus, 
 along with the value entered in the student’s defined character if the 
 student is attending that campus.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img src="assets/images/on-onsis-setup-campus-add.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:599px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">All the campuses should be added to the setup. 
  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-onsis-setup-campus2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:708px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The campus number setup will be saved and 
 used for all applicable submission periods.  </p>
