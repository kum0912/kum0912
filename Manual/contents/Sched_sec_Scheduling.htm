<h2><a id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>Once <a href="Sched_sec_Beginning_steps.htm">Part I: Beginning steps</a> 
 are completed, it is time to start scheduling the rest of the classes. 
 Scheduling means finding the best placements for each class. The best 
 placement is the semester/term and day/period patterns where the teacher 
 and room are available, and the fewest number of student conflicts exist. 
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The automatic scheduling tool (Master builder - Automatic) cannot schedule 
 a class into a placement where the teacher is teaching another class or 
 where the room is occupied by another class (unless the classes are intentionally 
 <a href="Scheduling_important_concepts.htm#Grouped_classes">grouped</a>). 
 This means that there is the potential for a better placement that would 
 reduce student conflicts, but the teacher and/or room are occupied. The 
 analysis tools will help identify classes with many student conflicts. 
 That&#39;s when the manual scheduling tool (Master builder - Manual) will 
 help you determine if there is a better placement if a different teacher 
 or room where assigned to the problem class. Hint: read the overview section 
 of <a href="sched-master-builder-manual.htm">Master builder - Manual</a> 
 for a better understanding of the information used to determine the best 
 placement for a class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are 3 steps to scheduling classes into their best placement.  Typically, 
 a school will schedule a small group of classes, repeating the 3 steps 
 until satisfied with the schedule for that small group of classes.  Then 
 another small group of classes are scheduled, again repeating the 3 steps 
 until satisfied. These 3 steps are repeated for small groups until all 
 classes are done:<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/scheduling.jpg" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:568px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before scheduling classes, give some consideration to what small groups 
 of classes may be scheduled and in what order.  The classes that 
 are scheduled early in process have a lower change of introducing student 
 conflicts, while classes scheduled later in the process will have fewer 
 placements as they need to work around the previously placed classes. 
  Here are some small class group considerations:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Classes that have limited room options with high demands (e.g. 
	 classes that must be scheduled into a single gym or  computer 
	 lab or  science lab).</li>
	<li>Courses that have only 1 class (aka single section classes). </li>
	<li>Senior level classes where students have compulsory courses in 
	 order to be accepted into post-secondary programs.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Here are some example groups:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Group 1 = all classes starting with PE (if all physical education 
	 classes start with PE)</li>
	<li>Group 2 = all single section classes</li>
	<li>Group 3 = all grade 12 classes</li>
	<li>Group 4 = all grade 11 classes</li>
	<li>Group 5 = all grade 10 classes</li>
	<li>Group 6 = all grade 9 classes </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The school is &#39;scheduled&#39; when:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>all classes have semester/term patterns and day/period patterns</li>
	<li>all classes have a teacher </li>
	<li>all classes have a room</li>
	<li>the final load students has been run and the majority of students 
	 have timetables (resolving individual student conflicts may still 
	 be needed).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Suggested_approach_to_scheduling_the_school"></a>Suggested 
 approach to scheduling the school</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="1._Schedule_classes"></a>1. Schedule classes</h3>
<p>Use <a href="sched-master-builder-auto.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; 
 Schedule classes &gt; Master builder - Automatic</a> to schedule a small 
 group of classes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This step may be repeated after step 3. If step 3 identifies &#39;problem&#39; 
 classes, it will provide a quick link to <a href="sched-master-builder-manual.htm">Master 
 builder - Manual</a> which provides all the information to help you decide 
 where to schedule the class, including the number of conflicts that would 
 be generated in each potential placement. Manual placement may highlight 
 a better location not available in the automatic mode because the teacher 
 and/or room were unavailable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If any class has a change to its schedule, you must go to step 2 so 
 that the students timetables will reflect the changes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="2._Assign_student_to_classes"></a>2. Assign student to classes</h3>
<p>Run <a href="sched-load-students.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Assign 
 students to classes &gt; Load students</a>. This process automatically 
 creates individual student timetables based on the master timetable and 
 the student&#39;s course selections. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This 
 step must be run after any changes to class schedules.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="3._Analyze_master_timetable"></a>3. Analyze master timetable</h3>
<p>Run <a href="sched-az-conflicts.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Analyze 
 master timetable &gt; Analyze conflicts</a> to identify &#39;problem&#39; classes. 
 These classes might have a better placement if analyzed further using 
 <a href="sched-master-builder-manual.htm">Master builder -manual</a> which 
 is accessed using the Schedule option that appears when you select a class. 
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another tool to analyze the master timetable is available using <a href="sched-tt-specific-group.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Schedule classes &gt; Timetable of specific group</a>. 
 Here are some examples of how this may help:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>By looking at the total number of students in each period, you 
	 can sense whether the timetable is balanced. For example, typically 
	 all students in grade 9 have full timetables (no spares), and these 
	 students typically only take grade 9 subjects. After scheduling the 
	 grade 9 classes you can see the number of students in each period. 
	 Looking at the nominal class size, you will see the theoretical number 
	 of students in the class assuming classes are perfectly loaded without 
	 conflicts (e.g. 2 classes with 42 students requesting the course would 
	 show 21 students per class).The numbers should be fairy even across 
	 the periods. If one period has too few students, and another period 
	 has too many students, consider analyzing the impact of moving classes 
	 around by using Master builder - Manual on a class in an over-loaded 
	 period to see if it can be moved to an under-loaded period).  <br/>
	</li>
	<li><span>By l</span>ooking at the actual class size, you can identify 
	 classes that are overloaded (if load students (step 2) was not limited 
	 to the maximum class size).  In this case, the overloaded classes 
	 are scheduled in a great spot, so consider analyzing the impact of 
	 moving the under-loaded class to a better location (using Master builder 
	 - Manual).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Remember that you may use <a href="shed-snapshots.htm">Scheduling next 
 year &gt; Classes &gt; Snapshots</a> to create a snapshot of the master 
 timetable at any point while experimenting with schedule changes. Snapshots 
 may be restored allowing you to return to the master schedule to the way 
 it was when the snapshot was created. If a snapshot is restored, you must 
 run load students (step 2) again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If any classes are rescheduled based on the analysis of the master timetable, 
 you have done step 1 (schedule classes) again, so proceed to step 2 after 
 all class changes are finished.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After scheduling this group of classes, create a <a href="shed-snapshots.htm">Snapshot</a> 
 when you are satisfied with the master timetable, then proceed to step 
 4.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="4._Repeat_steps_1_to_3"></a>4. Repeat steps 1 to 3</h3>
<p>Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 for the next group of classes.  This step 
 is repeated until all groups of classes are scheduled.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="5._Check_for_unscheduled_classes"></a>5. Check for unscheduled 
 classes</h3>
<p>Run <a href="sched-unsched-classes.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Schedule 
 Classes &gt; Unscheduled classes</a> to see if there are any classes that 
 are not yet scheduled. Students cannot be assigned into these classes. 
 If classes are found, you may select the class to access the schedule 
 option which will open <a href="sched-master-builder-manual.htm">Master 
 builder - Manual</a>, for the class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If any classes are scheduled here, return to step 2 so that students 
 will get scheduled into these classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="6._Assign_rooms_and_teachers"></a>6. Assign rooms and teachers</h3>
<p>Every class should have a teacher and a room.  Use <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Classes</a> to access the list of classes. 
 Sort by the teacher or room column to find classes with without teachers 
 or rooms.</p>
 <p> </p>
<p>In order to avoid creating teacher or room conflicts, we suggest that 
 these classes are assigned teachers and/or rooms using the features in 
 <a href="sched-master-builder-manual.htm">Master builder - Manual</a> 
 where you can clearly see available teachers and rooms for the selected 
 class. When the class is presented in Master builder - Manual, select 
 the block that is identified as &quot;current placement&quot; (make sure 
 you don&#39;t select any other placement so that you don&#39;t accidently reschedule 
 the class necessitating the return to step 2). This will open the scheduling 
 tools as shown below. Select the &#39;Available teachers&#39; or &#39;Available rooms&#39; 
 field to see teachers and rooms that available for this class during this 
 placement. If you select a teacher or room, icons appear to view the teacher&#39;s 
 timetable and to see room information.  Check the Set as new teacher 
 for class or Set as new room for class, then select the X in the Scheduling 
 tools card (or the CLOSE button on the master builder form and then select 
 the SAVE button when prompted. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/mabu-manual1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:917px;" border="0"/>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Repeat this process until all real classes have teachers and rooms (placeholder 
 classes like spares don&#39;t require this info).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another option for assigning teachers and rooms is to use the options 
 <a href="sched-class-available-teachers.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; 
 Classes &gt; Available teachers</a> or <a href="sched-class-available-rooms.htm">Available 
 rooms</a> to identify what&#39;s available for a specific semester/term/day/period. 
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Manual changes to teachers and rooms that are done without the use of 
 the scheduling tools have the potential to introduce teacher or room conflicts. 
 A conflict is when the teacher is scheduled to teach 2 or more non-grouped 
 classes at the same time, or a room is occupied by 2 or more non-grouped 
 classes at the same time.  Confirm that there are no teacher conflicts 
 by running <a href="sched-teacher-conflicts.htm">Scheduling next year 
 &gt; Analyze master timetable &gt; Teacher conflicts</a>. Confirm that 
 there are no room conflicts by running <a href="sched-room-conflicts.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Analyze master timetable &gt; Room conflicts</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use <a href="sched-teacher-master-timetable.htm">Scheduling next year 
 &gt; Classes &gt; Teacher master timetable</a> and <a href="sched-room-master-timetable.htm">Room 
 master timetable</a> to review all timetables quickly.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="7._Add_any_other_classes_"></a>7. Add any other classes </h3>
<p>Sometimes, schools like to add other classes into the student&#39;s timetables 
 after the timetabling is completed. For example, if every student has 
 a blank in period 3 for lunch, some schools add a placeholder lunch class 
 into the timetable.  There are tools that may assist with the mass 
 addition or removal of classes that may be available to assist with this 
 functionality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These tools may also assist K-12 schools where the elementary students 
 do not have course selections and so their classes are added after the 
 secondary students are scheduled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-timetables-addclass.htm">Scheduling next 
 year &gt; Assign students to classes &gt; Add classes</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-timetables-delclass.htm">Scheduling next 
 year &gt; Assign students to classes &gt; Delete classes</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-timetables-cleartt.htm">Scheduling next 
 year &gt; Assign students to classes &gt; Clear timetables</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note: if step 2 is run again, all timetable changes made using the above 
 tools will be lost.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="8._Proceed_to_Part_III:__Ending_steps"></a>8. Proceed to Part 
 III:  Ending steps</h3>
<p style="font-style: normal;">The school is &#39;scheduled&#39; when:</p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc; font-style: normal;">
	<li style="font-style: normal;">all classes have semester/term patterns
