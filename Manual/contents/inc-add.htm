	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" />
  <p>When you add an incident from the main menu you will need to select the student. When you add an incident from the student records screen you will be adding the incident directly to the record of the student involved.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>To add an incident choose Incident &gt; Student incidents and select GO from the Add incident card.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/add-incident-card.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 202px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The Add incident screen will appear:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/add-incident.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 503px;" /></p>
  <p>  </p>
  <h2><a id="Enter_incident_details"></a>Enter incident details</h2>
  <p>Enter incident details.</p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">Note: Before you can select students, you&#39;ll have to populate the required location field. Choose from the drop down list of fields that were created under <a href="../setup/setup-define-location.htm" style="font-style: italic;">Setup &gt; Incidents &gt; Locations</a>.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Date</span>: Enter or select the date the incident occurred.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Location</span> (mandatory in Ontario only): Windows shows “Other” but we should show “None selected” if empty.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Time</span>: Enter or select the time, it is required in Ontario only.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Time frame:</span> This is optional (can be set to None-selected.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Reported by</span>: Select from the drop down list from the Person types you set up using <a href="../setup/setup-define-person.htm">Setup &gt; Incidents &gt; Person types</a>. It will also include an option “Other” that is not in the setup table. This is an optional field.</p>
  <p>How it works:</p>
  <p>* If ‘reported by’ is a person type table entry, then look at the ‘role’ defined in the table to filter the “Name” field to show just those staff members with that role.  (e.g. if selecting reported by Teacher, and teacher is defined as role T, then show the names of all the staff with role T.</p>
  <p>* if ‘reported by’ is ‘Other’ (e.g. not a table entry), then show 4 additional fields:  Title, Given name, Surname, Phone number.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2><a id="Students_involved"></a> Students involved</h2>
  <p>Next select the students involved by using the Add icon. The standard Search student form will appear.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/add-student.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 495px;" /></p>
  <p>Check the boxes beside the applicable students.</p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">Hint: If more than one student is involved, checking the box, and performing another search will keep the original student selection in memory. Make your selections and click SELECT.</p>
  <h2><a id="Edit_student_incident_details"></a> Edit student incident details</h2>
  <p>Once you have selected all of the students involved it&#39;s time to enter incident details. Row click and select Edit.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><a id="Delete_student"></a> If you need to remove a student from the incident, select the Delete icon. You will be asked for confirmation.</p>

  <p>The student’s primary infraction is listed first.  Subsequent infractions can be listed in any order (order of entry would be best if possible).</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/infractions-card.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 573px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>

  <h2><a id="Consequence"></a>Consequence</h2>
  <p>The Consequences card lists the consequences (what happens to the student as a result of their infractions). The Consequence card will not be visible until you have added an infraction to the Infractions card.</p>
  <h3><a id="Add_a_consequence"></a>Add a consequence</h3>

  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/add-consequence.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 575px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The following fields are on the add/edit consequence interface:</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Consequence</span>: Select from the drop down field of options you set up under <a href="../setup/setup-define-conseq.htm">Setup &gt; Incidents &gt; Consequences</a>. The values should include both the title of the consequence (French title if using in French and title if it exists) AND the ministry code e.g. Suspension (4).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Primary consequence</span>: Yes/no check box.  </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>student can have only 1 primary consequence and they must have 1 flagged as primary consequence.</li>
    <li>* If adding the first consequence for the student, it should default Primary consequence = Y.  </li>
    <li>* If adding a second or subsequent consequence for the student, it should default N.  If it is changed from N to Y, then it must change the original primary consequence to No.  </li>
    <li>* if adding the first consequence for the student, it should default the consequence defined for the primary infraction (e.g. infraction table has a default consequence for each infraction).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Imposed by</span>:  Drop down options from the list of Person types that you set up under <a href="../setup/setup-define-person.htm">Setup &gt; Incidents &gt; Person types</a>, however it will only include those values that have the field ‘Able to suspend/expel’ set to Yes.  (there is no “Other” option like in the ‘reported by’ field).  E.g. here are some examples of the person type table showing this field:</p>
  <p>* If ‘Imposed by’ has a role (example 2 above), then look at the ‘role’ defined in the table to filter the “Name” field to show just those staff members with that role.  (e.g. if selecting reported by Teacher, and teacher is defined as role T, then show the names of all the staff with role T).</p>
  <p>* if ‘Imposed by’ has no role (example 1 above), then show 4 additional fields:  Title, Given name, Surname, Phone number.</p>
  <p>*‘Imposed by’ field is optional outside Ontario. Ontario has these business rules:</p>
  <p>(Ontario only) – ‘Imposed by’ is required if consequence is a suspension or expulsion (based on consequence table where ‘suspension type’ is anything other than ‘none’ as explained in R24)</p>
  <p>(Ontario only) – if consequence type is expelled (code 4 or 5), Imposed by must be the board (code 1).  (Technical note using onsis file terminology:  INFRACTION_OUTCOME_TYPE = 4 or 5 must have INFRACTION_AUTHORITY_TYPE = 1)</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Search</span>: You can add a staff member not listed by performing a Staff search.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Automatically calculate weekday duration</span>:  Y/N field.  If set to Yes, entering either the end date or the duration will automatically calculate the other field.  For example, if an end date is entered, the duration is automatically calculated.  If the duration is entered, the end date is automatically calculated.  Field is automatically set to No if effective or end dates are outside school calendar.  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Include exam days</span>:  Y/N to indicate whether exam days are counted in the calculation of the duration or end date.  This field is enabled when ‘automatically calculate weekday duration’ is set to Yes.</p>
