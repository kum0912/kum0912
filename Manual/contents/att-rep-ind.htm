<h1> Student reports &gt; Attendance &gt; Individual attendance</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="Individual_attendance_register" id="Individual_attendance_register"></a>This 
 report shows the daily attendance for a student for the entire school 
 year. Students with by period attendance will have their attendance reported 
 as am/pm. Here is an example of the individual attendance report:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep16.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:773px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>   </p>
<p>See <a href="att-rep-common-features.htm">Attendance reports common 
 features</a> for detailed information on the presentation of the student’s 
 attendance in this report.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This report is run for the students with the morning/afternoon attendance 
 method by selecting the AM/PM button on the card, and is run for the students 
 with the ‘by period’ attendance method by selecting the BY PERIOD button 
 on the card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep17.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:204px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Prior to generating the report, be sure to check all of the settings 
 to ensure you generate the right report.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select a print order from the header drop down list. Alphabet is the 
 default but you can also choose Class, Group, Grade, Excursion, Homeroom, 
 Defined character, and Advisor group. See Student reports common features 
 for more <a href="../students/stu-reports-commonfeatures.htm#Print_order">Print 
 order information</a>.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>The Setup options for the monthly attendance report are explained below.</p>
<h4>Attendance codes</h4>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: Students with the ‘By period’ attendance 
 method cannot use school attendance codes in this report. Therefore, this 
 setup option only appears when the report is run for the students with 
 the morning/ afternoon attendance method. <a href="att-common-features.htm">See 
 the common features section titled ‘By period’ attendance method – conversion 
 to AM/PM for additional information</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Set your preference for the attendance codes that are to appear on the 
 report by selecting from these options:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:301px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">School codes</span>: This shows the 
 exact attendance code (A –Z) assigned to the student.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Official codes</span>: This shows 
 official codes only (e.g. S – Sick recorded for a student will show as 
 A – Absent). Each school attendance code has an equivalent official code 
 to indicate whether the code is considered Present, Absent, Late, Suspended, 
 or Grant day (for unexpected school closures due to weather, infrastructure 
 issues).</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: By period students may not have 
 this option available if the report is converting the attendance to AM/PM 
 as explained in ‘By period’ attendance method – conversion to AM/PM.</p>
<h4>Additional information</h4>
<p>The individual attendance report will include 3 columns for the student’s 
 absence and late information for each month, along with either the student’s 
 full day absences or presence as a % of possible days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep18.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:502px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example of a portion of the report showing the last columns 
 using the full day absence option:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep19.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:444px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Using the example above, during April, the student had 2 morning absences 
 and 3 afternoon absences (am/pm column). For a total of 2.5 days absent 
 out of 18 possible school days for April (the tot column). So far this 
 year, the student has been absent 8.5 days out of 136 possible days (the 
 1st acc  column). During April, the student was absent 2 full 
 days (the F.D. column) and has had 8 full day absences since the start 
 of the school year (the 2nd acc column). <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: ‘acc’ 
 is the short form of accumulated.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It will also show the number of lates the student had for the month 
 broken down by morning afternoon (am/pm column), total for the month (tot. 
 column), and the accumulated number of lates since the start of the school 
 year (acc.). If a student is late in the morning and late in the afternoon, 
 it is counted as 2 times late. For example, this student was late 
 1 morning and 1 afternoon, for a total of 2 lates in September:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep20.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:781px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is a description of the options available from the Additional information 
 card:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Full day absence</span>: If this 
 option is selected, it will show the number of full days the student was 
 absent (e.g. if the student has A/L for a day, that day is not considered 
 a full day absence). In the example below, the student has A for 5 dates 
 in November, so the student is absent 5 full days (F.D. column) for a 
 total of 12 full days so far this year (the 1st acc. Column).  Note 
 how the /A and A/ dates do not count as a full day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep21.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:783px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Presence as a % of possible days</span>: If 
 this option is selected, it will convert the student’s attendance into 
 percentage of time the student was present at school for the month and 
 the accumulated total for the school year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the example below, the student was absent 1 day out of 18 possible 
 days in September (the 1st acc column).  Therefore, the student was 
 present 17/18 days. This is represented as 94% (17/18 x 100) in the 
 % P column. At the end of November, the student accumulated 2 absences 
 out of 54 possible days (the 1st acc column). This is represented 
 as 96% (52 days present/54 possible days x 100).</p>
<p> </p>

<h4>Report parameters</h4>
<p>This is where you select certain student information to be included 
 or excluded from the report by checking/unchecking the boxes beside the 
 options in the report parameters card shown below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep23.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:469px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include student details</span>: When 
 student details are included, this information is printed above the attendance 
 information:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Address</span>: The 
 student’s address.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Parent(s)/Guardian(s)</span>: 
 The student’s contacts that are flagged as the student’s legal guardian 
 (first 2 if more than 2).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Emergency</span>: 
 The name and phone number of the student’s contact that is flagged as 
 the first emergency contact. The emergency note will also appear in this 
 area unless you check the box to exclude it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enrolment</span>: 
 The student’s attendance type, entry date to this school and exit date. The 
 word “latest” will appear if the student has previous origin/retirement 
 information at this school (e.g. previous enrolment).  These previous 
 dates are not included on the report.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include code summary</span>: The 
 code summary will look different depending on whether the student has 
 the ‘by period’ or the ‘morning/afternoon’ attendance method.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">By period</span>: Since 
 only the official codes appear for these students, the code summary includes 
 only those codes (Absent, Late, Suspended, Grant). It will show the 
 number of times the student has each code in the morning and in the afternoon 
 as shown here:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/att-rep25.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:257px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Morning/afternoon</span>: 
 The code summary for a student with the ‘morning/afternoon attendance 
 method will categorize the school codes based on the official definition 
 of the code (e.g. whether it is an Absent, Late, Suspended, Grant day, 
 or Present) as shown here:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/att-rep26.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:861px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include attendance notes</span>: The 
 attendance notes for the current school year will be printed if this option 
 is selected. Each note includes a date and the text of the entered 
 note for that date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include legend</span>: If selected, 
 a legend explaining the calendar and attendance codes will appear below 
 the student’s attendance. <a href="att-rep-common-features.htm#Legends">See 
 Common features – Legends</a> for more information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exclude emergency note</span>: Some 
 schools enter non-emergency information into the student’s emergency note 
 field, and therefore, the emergency note may not be appropriate to include 
 on this report.</p>
