<h1><a id="Payments_overview"></a>Payments</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When someone gives the school funds for a specific student, those funds 
 are considered payments. Typically, each payment is associated with a 
 specific fee or multiple fees. Sometimes, payments are made that aren’t 
 linked to any fees, and these are called payment credits (e.g. if a payment 
 is made before a fee is applied).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a student owes $5 for a new lock, $20 for an activity fee, and $50 
 for a field trip, here are some examples of how payments affect fees and 
 outstanding account balances:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The student pays $5 cash. That $5 is automatically associated with 
	 the lock fee and that lock fee is considered paid in full.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The student then provides a $30 cheque. That cheque is automatically 
	 associated with the full $20 activity fee (so it is paid in full), 
	 and it is also used to pay $10 toward the field trip (leaving $40 
	 outstanding for the field trip).<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The student then provides another cheque for $50. That cheque 
	 is associated with the outstanding $40 for the field trip.  The 
	 extra $10 payment becomes a payment credit that can be applied later 
	 when new fees are added, or it can be refunded.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The parent provides an e-fund payment of $100, knowing that the 
	 student is going to have hockey fees. That $100 becomes a payment 
	 credit because it is not associated with any fees.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>The school adds the hockey fee of $125.  When the fee is added, 
	 it will suggest that the $110 in payment credits is used to pay this 
	 fee, and if this is done, the hockey fee balance will be $15.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Payments appear on Account Bills and other similar reports as a P, with 
 their respective receipt number.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Add_a_payment"></a>Add a payment</h2>
<p>You can make a payment using any of these methods :</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
	<li style="font-weight: bold;"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Access 
	 the student&#39;s record, and select SUMMARY or FEE TRANSACTION tab.  Click 
	 the FAB and select the Add payment icon:</p></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/fees-unpaid-payment-menu1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:64px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  </p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
	<li style="font-weight: bold;"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Access 
	 the student&#39;s record, and select the SUMMARY tab. Row click a fee 
	 and select Payment from the menu:</p></li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/fees-unpaid-payment-menu.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:256px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
	<li style="font-weight: bold;">Choose Fees, Student fees. Select GO 
	 on the Payment card. </li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/payment-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:190px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This is a quick way to record a payment - 
 one student at a time - without going into the student’s record. Once 
 you select a student, the Add payment form will open.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
	<li style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="fees-group-fees.htm">Group 
	 fees</a>?<span> </span></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Select all or some of the students in the 
 group to record the same payment information.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Here is the Add payment form:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/add-payment.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:652px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There will be a slightly different Add payment form if the student has 
 payment credits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since payments should be associated with fees, a Fees card will appear 
 listing all outstanding fees. The sum of these fees will appear in the 
 tool bar. The fees card is used when the amount of the payment is entered. 
  You&#39;ll see these fields:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Amount</span>:  The 
 dollar amount of the payment.  If there is a fee matching the amount, 
 it will automatically have a check in the box beside that fee in the Fees 
 card.  If there is no exact match, it will apply the fee to the most 
 overdue fee (if due dates are not used, it will use the fee with the oldest 
 transaction date).  It will apply to as many fees as needed, until 
 the entered payment amount is used up/dispersed. The amount applied to 
 each fee will appear in the ‘Amount to apply’ column so that the sum of 
 this column equals the amount entered in this field. The check boxes and 
 the amount to apply fields may be changed if the automatic association 
 is not the desired distribution of payment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alternately, if someone wishes to pay some of their fees, but they don’t 
 know the sum, check the boxes of the fees to be paid, adjust the ‘amount 
 to apply’ if only part of a fee is to be paid, then watch the Amount field 
 automatically adjust to the selected fees and amounts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Date</span>:  The 
 date of the payment (it will default today’s date).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Payment type</span>: 
  Select the type from the list of possible types.  Example types 
 might be Cash, Cheque, E-payment, etc.  See Setup payment types for 
 additional information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Receipt number</span>: 
  The receipt number is automatically assigned, but if needed, it 
 can be changed to any alphanumeric value as long as it is a unique number. 
  The application will automatically default the next available receipt 
 number based on the starting receipt number set up for the school.  See 
 Setup ….</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Cheque/Slip number</span>: 
  If applicable, optionally record a number corresponding to the number 
 on the cheque or other document provided for payment. This can provide 
 useful when tracking down NSF cheques.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Comment bank</span>: 
  (Only available if the school has set up a list of comments (see 
 Setup ….)).  Rather than enter a unique comment in the Comment field, 
 you may optionally select a comment from the school’s list of pre-defined 
 comments.  To use this feature, first select the drop down arrow 
 to pick the desired comment.  Then select the Copy icon located to 
 the right of the field.  The selected comment will then appear in 
 the comment field.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="assets/images/comment-bank.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:351px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Comments</span>:  A 
 comment may be optionally entered when adding a new payment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: Payments can be made even if no fees 
 are listed.  See Payment credits for details.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<h3><a id="Edit_a_payment"></a>Edit a payment</h3>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;">Once a you make a payment you can make changes, 
 but there are some rules:</p>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li style="color: #ff00ff;"><span>Edits to the payment date, payment 
	 type, Cheque/Slip No. and comment </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">are</span><span> 
	 permitted.<br/>
	</span></li>
	<li style="color: #ff00ff;"><span>Edits to the amount of the payment 
	 are </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span><span> allowed. 
	  If the payment was reversed due to a non-sufficient funds payment 
	 (e.g. NSF cheque), see NSF (Non-sufficient funds) payments. If 
	 the amount of the payment was entered incorrectly, void this payment 
	 and then create a new payment. See Voiding payments for details.<br/>
	</span></li>
	<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">If  the payment resulted in 
	 a payment credit where a refund was issued, the payment </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff00ff;">cannot</span><span style="color: #ff00ff;"> 
	 be voided or considered NSF.  If the refund was issued in error, 
	 it </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff00ff;">may</span><span style="color: #ff00ff;"> be voided, and then the payment can be voided 
	 or considered NSF.</span><br/>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="Void_a_payment"></a>Void a payment</h3>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;">Voids can be used to delete payments and refunds 
 only. Voids will not appear on the student’s record or any reports. There 
 is however an audit trail, and there is a record of this in the database 
 for audit purposes if needed.</p>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;"> </p>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;">A payment can be voided by following these steps:</p>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;"> </p>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;">• Access the student&#39;s record, and select the 
 FEE TRANSACTIONS tab. Row click a fee and select Payment from the menu:</p>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;">Go to the TRANSACTIONS tab. Select the row that 
 contains the payment.  This will provide a menu of options, including 
 a VOID option which will prompt a message to confirm that the payment 
 is to be voided.  To prevent accidental removal of payments, the 
 Void option is only available from the Transactions view.</p>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; color: #ff00ff;"> </p>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;">Note:  If  the payment resulted in 
 a payment credit where a refund was issued, the payment cannot be voided. 
  If the refund was issued in error, it may be voided, and then the 
 payment can be voided.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="NSF"></a>NSF (Non-sufficient funds) payments </h3>
<p>If a payment was made by cheque, and there is not enough money in the 
 cheque writer’s bank account to cover the amount, then the cheque is considered 
 NSF. Therefore, the school does not actually receive the funds and the 
 original payment record needs to be reversed so that the student still 
 owes the money.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Follow these steps when a payment is considered NSF:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• Go to the TRANSACTIONS tab.  Select the row that contains the 
 payment.  This will provide a menu of options.  Select the Edit 
 option.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• From the Edit payment form, select the NSF icon in the tool bar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• At the confirmation message, select the REVERSE button:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reversals appear on Account Bills and other similar reports as a N, 
 with their respective receipt number.  Labelling the payment as NSF 
 will create a reversal adjustment transaction as shown here:</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Note:  If  the payment resulted in a payment credit where 
 a refund was issued, the payment cannot be considered NSF.  If the 
 refund was issued in error, it may be voided, and then the payment can 
 be considered NSF.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Payment_credits"></a>Payment credits </h2>
<p>Payment credits displays the total amount of money that is in the student’s 
 account but that money is not yet associated with any fees.  This 
 is typically the result of overpayments that a student has made or if 
 a charge has been edited such to result in a surplus for a student the 
 amount is automatically categorized as a Payment Credit.</p>
<h3>How payment credits are created</h3>
<p>Here is an example of a situation where a payment credit is created:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• The parent provides an e-fund payment of $100, knowing that the student 
 is going to have hockey fees. That $100 becomes a payment credit because 
 it is not associated with any fees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here’s the add payment form when the student has no outstanding (unpaid) 
 fees:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Upon saving, the following dialogue will be presented :</p>
<p>The amount you have entered is greater than the amount you have applied 
 to fees.  The excess payment will become a payment credit which can 
 be applied to future fees or refunded.</p>
<p>                                                                  FIX 
 PAYMENT      CREATE PAYMENT CREDIT</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here’s the add payment form when the student has outstanding (unpaid) 
 fees, but the payment is more than the amount applied to fees:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As previously mentioned, payment credits are typically the result of 
 overpayments that a student has made or if a charge has been edited such 
 to result in a surplus for a student, the amount is automatically categorized 
 as a Payment Credit.  Here are some further examples of how payment 
 credits are created:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The student had a class in their timetable with a fee and paid 
	 the course fee.  The student then dropped the course within the 
	 allowable refund time.  Since the fee was paid already, a payment 
	 credit would be automatically created when the class was dropped from 
	 the student’s timetable.</li>
	<li>The student paid a fee.  The amount of the fee was then reduced, 
	 or voided.  Since the fee was paid already, a payment credit 
	 would be automatically created when the fee amount was reduced. </li>
	<li>A deposit was paid.  Rather than refunding the deposit, the 
	 deposit money was converted to a payment credit.  This is done 
	 by selecting the deposit (click the row) and then select the option 
	 Convert to payment credit, as shown here:</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Adding a new fee will suggest that payment credit is used. If payment 
 credits exists for a student, when a new fee is added, it will present 
 the following dialogue:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If YES is selected, it will go to the form to associate the payment 
 credits with the student’s outstanding fees as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This form operates just like the regular payment form, except that you 
 are using the payment credits for the payment.  All or part of the 
 payment credits may be applied to the fees. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Using_payment_credits_to_pay_outstanding_fees"></a>Using payment 
 credits to pay outstanding fees</h2>
<p>Sometimes a student can have both outstanding fees and payment credits. 
  Although any new fees will suggest that payment credits are used 
 to pay for those new fees, users can choose not to apply the existing 
 payment credits at the time of a new fee.  As well, when adding student 
 fees using the Group fees feature, it does not check for payment credits.</p>
<p>If this scenario exists, an icon will appear in the bottom right corner 
 of the Payment credits card on the student’s summary view.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Select the Apply credits to fees icon to access the form 
 where the payment credits can be associated to the student’s outstanding 
 fees (as shown in earlier in Adding a new fee will suggest that a payment 
 credit is used).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="Making_a_payment_when_the_student_has_payment_credits"></a>Making 
 a payment when the student has payment credits</h3>
<p>When payment credits exist for a student, adding a payment will present 
 a slightly different version of the add payment form, as shown below. 
  It will appear as a stepper, and you will start on step 2.  Step 
 2 is just like the regular payment form except it has a question asking 
 you whether or not you want to use the payment credit.  If you say 
 NO, the question will collapse and you can proceed to make a payment as 
 usual.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you say YES to the question, it will go to step 1 where all or part 
 of the payment credits can be applied to existing fees, as shown below 
 .  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you have set the amount to be applied, use the SAVE AND CONTINUE 
 button to proceed to step 2 where an additional payment can be entered.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Refunds"></a>Refunds </h2>
<p>Refunds are issued when funds are returned to the student.  Refunds 
 can be issued when:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• the student has payment credits (as explained in How payment credits 
 are created) </p>
<p>• the student has deposited money and that can now be returned (see 
 Deposits for details).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If no refunds are applicable/available for a student, the refund functionality 
 described here will be hidden.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hint:  If the student paid a fee, and that payment is to be refunded 
 to the student, you must first void the fee (see Voiding fees).  This 
 will convert the payment into a payment credit which may then be refunded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Refund icon</h4>
<p><img src="assets/images/refund-icon.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:17px;" border="0"/>

<p>Note :  Once a refund is issued, only the date and comment fields 
 may be edited. If needed, the refund can be voided (as if the refund 
 were never entered).  From the TRANSACTIONS tab, select the refund 
 (row click) to access the Edit or Void options.</p>
