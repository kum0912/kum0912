<h1>Student records &gt; Attendance &gt; Notes</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>The Attendance option in a student’s record contains information related 
 to the student’s attendance. You can enter and modify attendance from 
 the student’s record, but typically this is not where you enter daily 
 attendance.  If you are not already familiar with the attendance 
 functionality, <a href="../attendance/att-rep-common-features.htm#Overview">see 
 the Attendance section</a> of the manual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Notes option allows provides access to all the attendance notes 
 entered for the student, including notes from previous years.  Ontario 
 schools will also find access to Contact notes and Attendance monitoring 
 fields.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="#Notes">Notes</a></p>
<p><a href="#Attendance_monitoring">Attendance monitoring</a> (Ontario 
 schools only)</p>
<p><a href="#Contact_notes">Contact notes</a> (Ontario schools only)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This option is not applicable to past students who attended the school 
 in previous years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Choose Attendance &gt; Summary from the submenu of the student’s record. 
 </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Students_attending_multiple_schools_this_year" id="Students_attending_multiple_schools_this_year"></a>Students 
 attending multiple schools this year</h2>
<p>If a student attends more than 1 school in your board/division/district 
 in the current school year, you can select a different school from the 
 Schools drop down list.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sel-concurrent.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:327px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Notes"></a>Notes</h2>
<p>The student&#39;s attendance notes, including notes from previous years, 
 will appear in the Attendance notes card.  Although notes are typically 
 entered during the daily attendance process, they may be added/edited 
 here if needed.  Select the attendance note to access the Edit option. 
 Use the Add icon in the tool bar to add a new note for a new date. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-att-notes1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:737px;" border="0"/></p>
<h2><a id="Attendance_monitoring"></a>Attendance monitoring</h2>
<p>This card appears for Ontario schools only.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-att-notes2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:364px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the Edit icon in the tool bar if the following yes/no fields need 
 to be changed:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Active attendance counsellor last school 
 year or start of this school year:</span>  Set this field to yes 
 if the student has an active attendance counsellor last school year or 
 at the start of this school year. When it is set to Yes, the student will 
 be admitted to the enrolment register on the first day of school even 
 if the student&#39;s attendance was entered as absent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Habitually absent:</span>  This 
 field is for the school&#39;s use only to flag students who are habitually 
 absent.  In the past, this was a field collected by OnSIS.</p>
<h2><a id="Contact_notes"></a>Contact notes</h2>
<p>This card appears for Ontario schools only.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Contact notes may be recorded for those students with an active attendance 
 counsellor at any time during the school year. This feature is available 
 even if the attendance counsellor field is set to No on the Attendance 
 monitoring card. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The attendance counsellor must attempt to make successful two-way communication 
 with the pupil and/or the pupil&#39;s parent/guardian every 15 day-period 
 in order to keep the pupil on the register. See the Ministry&#39;s Enrolment 
 Register Instructions for Elementary and Secondary Schools for more information 
 on these requirements.  When contact is made, a &#39;C&#39; will be indicated 
 on the student&#39;s Attendance Register. Contact notes are considered when 
 finding students with consecutive absences (e.g. a search for 15 or more 
 consecutive absences will exclude an absent student if there is successful 
 contact with the pupil within the 15 days).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a student is absent at the start of the school year, the Ministry 
 enrolment register requires * (not enrolled) until the first time the 
 student shows up to school; unless the pupil was referred to an attendance 
 counsellor in the previous school year and whose file is still active. 
 In edsembli SIS, if the student’s contact note on the first day of school 
 has Yes indicated in the ‘Contact with pupil’ field, the student is considered 
 enrolled, and therefore the student&#39;s attendance register will reflect 
 the student’s actual attendance (e.g. A rather than *).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If contact notes have been entered, they will appear on the card. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-att-notes3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:365px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the Add icon in the tool bar to add a new note. Select an existing 
 note to access the Edit option. The date and a note are required, however 
 the Contact with pupil field is only set to yes if the counsellor made 
 successful contact.</p>
