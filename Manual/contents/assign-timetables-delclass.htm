  <p class="Style1">This tool provides a quick way to delete one or many classes from the timetables of a group of students. For example, if a class will no longer be offered to students, you could remove that class for the whole school (using the alphabet option). This is much faster than editing each student’s timetables, one at a time.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>You can delete classes from either this year’s timetables or next year’s timetables.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Each student has a dated record of all their timetable adds and drops (for this year’s timetable). The date the class was removed from the student’s timetable is automatically recorded, however, if the drop date is prior to the class start date, no add/drop dates will exist for the class.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Attendance and achievement information, where applicable, is retained for dropped classes even though they are no longer part of the student’s timetable.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">Note: If all classes in the group of students’ timetables are to be removed, the <a href="assign-timetables-cleartt.htm">Clear timetables</a> tool may be faster.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>To access this tool, choose Student tools &gt; Timetables then select THIS YEAR or NEXT YEAR on the Delete classes card, depending on whether you are deleting classes from this year’s or next year’s timetables.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-hmrm22.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:235px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The Timetable - Delete classes main screen will appear:</p>
  <p>First, the group of students is selected from the standard student filter settings. In the example below, the filter is set to alphabet and the first and last student in the school is selected (e.g. it will search the whole school). Start typing the class to be deleted In the box located in the  &#39;Classes included&#39; card. When the class appear in the list, select it or simply press the Enter key. The class will then appear in the Classes to delete card. Continue entering additional classes until all classes appear in the Classes to delete card.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-tt5.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 677px;" /></p>
  <p>Select an order from the header drop down list. Alphabet is the default but you can also choose Class, Group, Grade, Excursion, Homeroom, Defined character, and Advisor group. Student reports common features describes the <a href="stu-reports-commonfeatures.htm#Print_order">order selection information</a>.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Include students registered</span> - Select the registered type, both this year and next year. This year only (not returning), Next year only or Withdrawn (no longer enrolled this year).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Classes included</span> - Simply start typing the name of the class that you want to delete. Select the classes by clicking the class in the search list.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-tt9.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 516px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As each class is selected, it will appear in the Classes to add card:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-tt10.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 537px;" /></p>
  <p>You can delete individual courses from this card by selecting the row&#39;s delete icon. To clear all classes select the delete icon in the header.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Options</span> - Check that this card has the selected setting that you want for this additional field:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Adjust course fees where applicable</span>: Select this option if course fees are used in your school. If course fees apply to a class, when the class is successfully deleted, the corresponding course fee will no longer apply if the drop is within the allowable refund period. The refund period is setup for each course.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-weight: normal;">Once the group of students is defined, and the class or classes are selected, select the DELETE CLASSES button at the bottom of the page. Once the process is complete, the classes will no longer appear in the students’ timetables.</p>
