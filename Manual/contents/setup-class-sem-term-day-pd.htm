<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>The setup of a school’s semesters, terms, days and periods is generally 
 is done during the initial set up of a new school and rarely needs to 
 be revisited. The exception would be if a school makes changes to 
 the core schedule (i.e. changes in any of the parameters that define when 
 classes are taught):</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Number of semesters in the school year</li>
	<li>Number of terms per semester</li>
	<li>Number of days in the cycle</li>
	<li>Number of periods per day</li>
	<li>Start and end times of each period in each day</li>
	<li>Changes to the tumble/rotation of classes</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Semesters/terms/days/ and/or periods setup is available for this year 
 and next year. The existing set up is automatically copied to next 
 year. Any changes that you make for the next school year will not impact 
 the current year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a separate class for each time a course is taught to a different 
 group of students. “When” each class is taught is called  the 
 class schedule. The class schedule provides information that lets the 
 class fit into the student and teacher timetables. In order for all 
 the classes to fit into the timetables, classes have both Semester/Term 
 Sets and Day/Period Sets with associated patterns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are sets with patterns for when a class is taught with respect 
 to the semesters/terms (duration), and there are sets with  patterns 
 for when a class is taught with respect to the day and period (rotation).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A set is a main grouping that contains all the appropriate possible 
 patterns and is  a critical attribute if you plan to use any of the 
 automatic scheduling features.  A set contains patterns, and when 
 building a timetable, you indicate the appropriate set for a class and 
 let the timetable building application determine the best pattern that 
 belongs to that set or you can manually assign the desired pattern. Please 
 see below <a href="#Understanding_day_period_sets_and_patterns">Understanding 
 sets and patterns</a> for a more detailed explanation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the main menu select Setup &gt; School. This will take you to the 
 School section of the setup page where you will find the Semesters/terms/days/periods 
 card. The board will not see this card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:201px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select either THIS YEAR or NEXT YEAR. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note: this card is also available from the Scheduling next year &gt; 
 Prepare for next year. When accessed this way, the card will provide a 
 GO button and it will only modify next year&#39;s sets and patterns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are 2 tabs available corresponding to the different setup features.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="#Semester_term_setup">Semester/term</a></p>
<p><a href="#Day_period_setup">Day/Period</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before using the setup application you should first understand the terminology 
 and intended usage of the sets and patterns for semester/term and day/period. 
 Here are some examples.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Understanding_semester_term_sets_and_patterns" id="Understanding_semester_term_sets_and_patterns"></a>Understanding 
 semester/term sets and patterns</h3>
<p>This areas refers to the ‘duration of a class’. How long it lasts/spans 
 during a school year. If a school has some full year classes (September 
 to June), many classes that are taught for a single semester (half the 
 year) and some classes that are taught for a quarter of the year (or half 
 a semester), the school would typically be set up as 2 semesters, and 
 2 terms per semester.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this example there would be three Sets (Full Year, Semester and Term) 
 each with their own unique and appropriate patterns. For example, 
 the “Semester” set would have 2 patterns because there are 2 possible 
 schedules: semester 1 or semester 2. Sample set and pattern names 
 might be:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Set = Semester (main grouping)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patterns</span>: 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sem 1 and Sem 2 (possible times within 
 the group when classes can be taught. Either Semester 1 or Semester 2)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:709px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The “Term” set would have 4 patterns because there are 4 possible schedules: 
 semester 1/term 1, semester 1/term 2, semester 2/term 1, semester 2/term 
 2. Sample set and pattern names are often short but meaningful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Set = Term</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Patterns 
 = Sem1Term1, Sem1Term2, Sem2Term1, Sem2Term2.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:748px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">The “Full year” set would have only 1 pattern 
 because it has only 1 possible schedule. The set and pattern name can 
 be the same or different, but both a set and a pattern must exist. If 
 only 1 pattern exists, it will be automatically given to a class with 
 this set.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Set = Full year</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Pattern = Full year</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:542px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<h3><a name="Understanding_day_period_sets_and_patterns" id="Understanding_day_period_sets_and_patterns"></a>Understanding 
 day/period sets and patterns</h3>
<p>This areas refers to the ‘rotation of a class’. How it tumbles 
 or rotates within a cycle. In this example, the school has 4 periods 
 each day and runs on a 2 day cycle. Most classes are assigned to 
 a single period that is taught on both day 1 and day 2. However, the school 
 has some classes that are taught every other day (alternating day classes) 
 and some classes that are taught in for the morning or afternoon for a 
 double period (i.e. morning co-op).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, let’s set up for the classes that make up the majority 
 of the classes, the regular rotation and we’ll call the set the Regular. 
 This set would have 4 patterns (possibilities) because there are 4 possible 
 schedules into which a class could fall: Period 1, or Period 2 or Period 
 3 or  to Period 4. Sample set and pattern names:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Set = Regular</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Patterns:  Period 
 1, Period 2, Period 3, Period 4</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">For each pattern, all the periods for each 
 of the days are presented (days in columns, periods in rows). For each 
 day in the cycle, the periods, where this pattern is taught, are checked 
 off as shown here:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:284px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Once all the patterns are defined, they will appear like this (note: 
 only Period 1 and Period 2 patterns are shown here):</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/regperiodset.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:748px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The half day set would have 2 patterns because there are 2 possible 
 schedules: mornings or afternoons. Sample set and pattern names are often 
 short but meaningful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Set = Half day</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Patterns = AM, PM</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p>The alternate day set would have 8 patterns because the class may be 
 taught in one of the 4 periods on day 1 or one of the four periods on 
 day 2 (e.g. period 1 day 1 or period 1 day 2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Set = Alt day</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;">Patterns = P1D1, P2D1, 
 P3D1, P4D1, P1D2, P2D2, P3D2, P4D2</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<h2><a name="Semester_term_setup" id="Semester_term_setup"></a>Semester/term 
 setup</h2>
<p>All semester/term setup features are available from the SEMESTER/TERM 
 tab shown below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:665px;" border="0"/> 
  </p>
<h3><a name="Defining_number_of_semesters_terms" id="Defining_number_of_semesters_terms"></a>Defining 
 number of semesters/terms</h3>
<p>From the SEMESTER/TERM tab, you will see the current number of semesters 
 and terms per semester on the Semester/term card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd10.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:546px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> If you have to change these numbers, use the Edit icon on the 
 tool bar to adjust the numbers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd9.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:404px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Note: it is not possible 
 to reduce the number of semesters or terms if patterns are defined using 
 those semesters or terms that you want removed. </p>
<h3><a name="Editing_semester_term_sets_and_patterns" id="Editing_semester_term_sets_and_patterns"></a>Editing 
 semester/term sets and patterns</h3>
<p>Once you understand semester/term sets and patterns, you will notice 
 that the setup application, when set to the SEMESTER/TERM tab, will have 
 a card for each set defined by the school. The set cards are located below 
 the Semester/Term card. In the example below, the card titled ‘Semester’ 
 is a set card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd11.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:665px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Patterns associated with each each set card will be listed, and will 
 also indicate in which semesters and terms this pattern is taught. For 
 example, the Semester set has a pattern called Sem 1. Any classes assigned 
 this pattern will be taught in Semester 1 Term 1 and Semester 1 Term 2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the Add icon on the set tool bar to add a new pattern to the set, 
 or row click and select edit. You will see a similar screen to add or 
 edit the pattern. This is an example of the edit interface where you can 
 specify the name of the pattern, and the semester/terms where the pattern 
 is taught.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd12a.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:309px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To edit the set name, use the Edit icon on the set card’s tool bar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd13.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:746px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Editing the set will allow the name of the set to be edited as show 
 below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd14.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:290px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Day_period_setup" id="Day_period_setup"></a>Day/period setup</h2>
<p>All day/period setup features are available from the DAY/PERIOD tab 
 as shown below:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd15.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:734px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The cards on each tab are detailed below.  </p>
<h3><a name="Defining_number_of_days_periods" id="Defining_number_of_days_periods"></a>Defining 
 number of days/periods</h3>
<p>From the DAY/PERIOD tab, the current number of days per cycle and periods 
 per day are shown on the Day/period card. If you need to change these 
 numbers, use the Edit icon on the tool bar to adjust the numbers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd16.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:701px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: You can&#39;t reduce the number 
 of days or periods if patterns are defined using those days or periods 
 that you want removed.</span>   </p>
<h3><a name="Editing_day_period_sets_and_patterns" id="Editing_day_period_sets_and_patterns"></a>Editing 
 day/period sets and patterns</h3>
<p>Once you understand day/period sets and patterns, you will notice that 
 the setup application, when set to the DAY/PERIOD tab, will have a card 
 for each set defined by the school. The set cards are located below the 
 Day/Period and Period times cards. In the example below, the card titled 
 ‘All day’ is a set card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd18.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:740px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each set card, the patterns associated with that card are listed, 
 with a visual indication of which days and periods this pattern is taught 
 in.  For example, the All  day set has a pattern called Day 
 1 &amp; 2. Any classes assigned this pattern will be taught in periods 
 1 &amp; 2, on days 1 and 2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the Add icon on the set tool bar (e.g. the card called All day shown 
 above) to add a new pattern to the set, or select the row with the pattern 
 that requires edit. This will take you to a similar screen to add or edit 
 the pattern. This is an example of the edit interface where the name of 
 the pattern, and the days/periods where the pattern is taught can be specified.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd19.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:281px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the set name requires editing, use the Edit icon on the set card’s 
 tool bar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd20.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:502px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Adding_new_sets_and_patterns" id="Adding_new_sets_and_patterns"></a>Adding 
 new sets and patterns</h2>
<p>The process of adding new sets and patterns is the same for Semester/Term 
 and Day/Period information. The examples below show Semester/Term patterns 
 and sets, but the same process applies to Day/Period sets and patterns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An Add floating action button (FAB) will appear on the lower right corner 
 as soon as you access the Semester/Term/Day/Period setup application. 
 The Add FAB on the SEMESTER/TERM tab will add a new semester/term set. 
 The Add FAB on the DAY/PERIOD tab will add a new day/period set. Selecting 
 the Add FAB and enter a set name.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd22.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:649px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the set is created, a card will appear with that set name. Use 
 the Add icon in the tool bar of the set card to add a new pattern. Each 
 new pattern will have a name and then the semester/terms or day/periods 
 where it is taught are selected. This is an example of adding a semester/term 
 pattern for a school with 2 semesters, 2 terms:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd24.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:308px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Removing_sets_or_patterns" id="Removing_sets_or_patterns"></a>Removing 
 sets or patterns</h2>
<p>The process of removing sets and patterns is the same for Semester/Term 
 and Day/Period information. The examples below show Semester/Term patterns 
 and sets, but the same process applies to Day/Period sets and patterns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sets and patterns may not be removed if they are used by any class (in 
 the current school year if in the setup of this year, or in the forthcoming 
 school year if in the setup of next year). If the set or pattern is in 
 use, a message will appear indicating the reason why it cannot be removed 
 .</p>
<h3><a name="Removing_sets" id="Removing_sets"></a>Removing sets</h3>
<p>First, select the Edit icon on the set card’s tool bar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Upon selecting Edit above, the Delete icon will be located on the Edit 
 set tool bar as shown below. Select this icon to remove the set.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd27.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:732px;" border="0"/></p>
<h3><a name="Removing_patterns" id="Removing_patterns"></a>Removing patterns</h3>
<p>Edit the pattern by selecting the row containing the pattern and selecting 
 Delete.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd28.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:567px;" border="0"/></p>
<h2><a name="Defining_period_times" id="Defining_period_times"></a>Defining 
 period times</h2>
<p>Be sure to accurately define period times, i.e. the period start and 
 end. The period times may be different on each day in the school’s cycle, 
 but often they are the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The period times are used in any reports that require a count of the 
 minutes of instruction for classes. These times are also used to determine 
 a student’s current location by comparing where the student should be 
 vs where the student actually is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the setup application, select the DAY/PERIOD tab to see the Period 
 times card (located below the Defined period times section which is collapsed 
 in the example below).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd30.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:733px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the Edit icon on the Period times card (shown above), to set the 
 start and end times for each period. Times must be in chronological order, 
 but the end time of one period may be the same as the start time for the 
 next period, or the next period may be later to account for travel time 
 between classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/semtermdaypd31.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:751px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once you have defined the period times for day 1, those times may be 
 copied to the other days by selecting the More icon on the edit period 
 times card to access the All days alike option. You can also print by 
 selecting Print from the More icon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the period times are different between each day in the school’s cycle,

<h2><a name="Unique_class_schedules" id="Unique_class_schedules"></a>Unique 
 class schedules</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Classes without periods (floater classes)</span>: 
 Many schools create a day/period set and pattern called Floater (or Unscheduled 
 or Period X or any other meaningful name) for classes that are assigned 
 into a semester/term, but are not scheduled into any period. These classes 
 can have achievement data but they cannot have attendance stored because 
 they have no period (something to consider for students with the &#39;by period&#39; 
 attendance method).</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple schedules (multiple occurrences)</span>: 
 Each class’ schedule is defined in the class. There may be times where 
 a class has a unique situation where they require more than 1 schedule 
 to accurately indicate when a class is taught. For example, if a class 
 is taught all year long, but it changes from period 1 to period 2, it 
 is possible to set up 2 schedules in the class without the need to create 
 a unique set/pattern. Multiple schedules for 1 class are sometimes referred 
 to as occurrences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Schedule 1:  Semester/Sem 1, Regular/Period 
 1</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Schedule 2:  Semester/Sem 2, Regular/Period 
 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special schedule</span>: There are 
 also times where the definition of sets and patterns is simply not practical 
 for a school. This is often the case where a timetable is manually created 
 without any formal patterns. For these situations, the class’ schedule 
 may be defined directly in the setup of the class rather than creating 
 a unique pattern here.  In the set up of the class, it may be flagged 
 as requiring a special schedule which then allows the user to select the 
 specific semesters/terms and days/periods unique to that class. These 
 classes will be automatically listed in a card called Special Schedule 
 located at the bottom of the semester/term and day/period setup page. 
 Patterns cannot be added/edited here.  Note: Any automatic timetabling 
 tools cannot schedule these types of classes.</p>

<h2><a name="Notes_for_new_schools" id="Notes_for_new_schools"></a>Notes 
 for new schools</h2>
<p>When adding a new class is created, the class schedule will default 
 the first set alphabetically, and when selecting sets and patterns from 
 drop down lists, the names will be listed in alphabetical order.  For 
 this reason, some schools add numbers in front of the set and pattern 
 names to force a specific order, while most schools leave the names as 
 they want.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Typically, new schools will have sets and patterns automatically created 
 as data is imported from other sources, however the names of the sets 
 and patterns may be changed to better suit the terminology used in the 
 schools. See <a href="#Editing_semester_term_sets_and_patterns">Editing 
 semester/term sets and patterns</a> or <a href="#Editing_day_period_sets_and_patterns">Editing 
 day/period sets and patterns</a> for additional information.</p>
