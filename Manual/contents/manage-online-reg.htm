<h1>Manage online registrations</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify;

<p>SIS users can register students in their school when a registration 
 has been received from the web service. User will select the Manage online 
 registrations option under the Student tools menu, and will be presented 
 with a list of students to be registered. Once a student is selected from 
 this list, the search function for Add new students will be performed, 
 and if a match is found they will be presented. If no match is found, 
 the user will be prompted to Enrol this student as a new student. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are three other buttons in this interface, including View submission, 
 which allows the user to view the contents of the actual JSON file that 
 was sent from the Web service, View Reg form, which allows the user to 
 view the values the user entered in the Online registration form (NOT 
 produced in Maplewood, produced via a third party) or Send to school, 
 which allows the user to select another school in the board to send the 
 student to (for example, if the parent has registered the student in the 
 wrong school for their catchment area).</p>

 as you know into the search area. Surname is a required field.</p>

 school select appears. You can select one school only (multi select is

<h2>Enrolled Students Concurrent Online Registration </h2>
<p>If the already entered students in the school are provided access to 
 Maplewood connectEd Students, with appropriate rights granted, those students 
 can register at another school in your board.  This new option will 
 allow the student to see all their concurrent school registrations in 
 the board (present, and future).  The Registration option will also 
 provide new functionality to the student; the ability to request/submit 
 a registration at another school within the board.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Once the student has provided this Request for Registration at another 
 school, the other school can accept or decline the registration (through 
 the Enrol Students from this Board tool).  Once enrolled in a new 
 school, the student can then (and only then) proceed with entering their 
 courses selections for that new school.</p>
<p>Overview of business process:</p>
<p>Dependencies:</p>
<p>• Student must be enrolled in one school within the board (at least).</p>
<p>• For students with concurrent enrolments within a board (more than 
 one), the Registration option is ONLY available at the Home school.</p>
<p>1. School provides students access to Maplewood connectEd’s Registration 
 option</p>
<p>School will have a new option under School Information - Configuration 
 to Allow Online Registrations.  In Maplewood connectEd’s security, 
 you must set new permission for the Students to get access to the new 
 Registration screen at the student’s home school.  We would suggest 
 setting these in your templates for Student so that any new student will 
 get this by default.</p>
<p>2. Student enters their request for registration</p>
<p>The student logs onto Maplewood connectEd.  </p>
<p>The student will have a Registration menu option, (as shown below). 
 It will show the student’s request(s) for registrations at another school(s) 
 in the board (which will typically be empty to start), followed by the 
 school(s) where the student is currently enrolled in the board and any 
 choices (course selections) already entered at enrolled schools.  Will 
 not display choices for the school that student is currently logged in 
 to.</p>
<p>As shown below, from the Request Registration at another School area, 
 the student will use the drop down lists to select the school they would 
 like to attend (e.g. Maplewood Summer School) and for which school year. 
  Dates corresponding to either this school year or next school year 
 are available for selection). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>If the student has a school listed in the Request area, and it is locked, 
 this means that the school office has indicated that the student is leaving 
 this school to attend that other school (e.g. the school is recorded in 
 the destination school but the receiving school has not yet enrolled the 
 student by running the process to enroll students from this board.  </p>
<p>3. The Requested School(s) Accepts the Student’s Registration Request</p>
<p>Using the utility Enrol Students from This Board, the requested school 
 can accept (or decline) the student’s request for enrolment.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note: The List of Students to be Transferred will depend upon the selected 
 Maplewood Status.  If This Year and Next or This Year Only is selected, 
 the list of students to be transferred will include the students who have 
 requested an enrollment at this school for the current school year (ie. 
 2016/17).  If Next Year Only is selected, the list of students to 
 be transferred will include the students who have requested an enrollment 
 at this school for the upcoming school year (ie. 2017/18).  </p>
<p>In both instances, students with a Destination School of the current 
 and/or an existing entry in the office Pre-registration will also appear 
 on the list of Students to be Transferred. </p>
<p>Once enrolled, the Requested School will need to grant permission for 
 the student to enter Choices (course selections).  If the school 
 has set up default permission, no action is required as these are inherited 
 with the enrolment entry.</p>
<p>4. Student enters their course selections for the newly enrolled school 
 </p>
<p>From the student’s Home School Maplewood connectEd login (the student 
 will be able to enter their course selections (choices) for the newly 
 enrolled school(s) within the Registration menu option. Once the school 
 has accepted the student’s registration request the school will appear 
 in the Schools area of the Registration option (shown below).</p>
<p>In the Choices column, click the Edit button for the school you wish 
 to view or edit choices. The school’s name will appear in the title ‘Student 
 Choices for XXX School’.   The student will use the Add and 
 Remove buttons to enter course selections (choices).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Courses available for selection are from the courses in that school’s 
 Next Year’s courses table.  It will include only those courses that 
 have the boxed checked off in the “Show in Online Selection” field.  </p>
<p>If the student is enrolled for the next school year, the entry of courses 
 can only begin after the school has initialized scheduling in preparation 
 for the next school year.</p>
<p>5. New school creates timetable for the student</p>
<p>Once the course selections (Choices) are entered, the school will use 
 that information to create a timetable for the student. </p>
<p>For students who are registered for the current school year, the school 
 will need to specifically edit the student’s timetable in order for the 
 students to be enrolled in classes.  Edit timetable has a feature 
 where the student’s unscheduled choices can be displayed so that the student’s 
 class sections can be easily picked, or the timetable suggestions feature 
 can be used to automatically build the student’s timetable.</p>
<p>For students who are registered for the next school year, the timetables 
 are created as part of the school’s scheduling process, just like all 
 other students who are attending the school next year.</p>
