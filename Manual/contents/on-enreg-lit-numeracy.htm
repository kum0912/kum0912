  <hr align="center" style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify;

  <p>The Literacy &amp; numeracy program option provides Ontario schools and boards with the ability to generate the official Register of Enrolment in the Literacy and Numeracy Program. This register option is available to publicly funded Ontario boards and schools set up with ‘school operating type’ of continuing education or summer school. It is also available to other schools whose <a href="../setup/setup-school-configuration.htm">school configuration</a> is set up such that they also require access to continuing education registers.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This is a classroom-based register used to record enrolment and attendance for pupils enrolled in the following courses:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Grade 7 or 8 Remedial Literacy and Numeracy  </li>
    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
      <ul style="list-style: disc;">
        <li>During the school year outside of the regular school day  </li>
        <li>In the summer.  </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 84px; font-style: italic;">Note: Students who have completed Grade 6 are eligible to enrol in this program during the summer.  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Non-credit Grade 9 or 10 Remedial Literacy and Numeracy  </li>
    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
      <ul style="list-style: disc;">
        <li>During the school year outside of the regular school day  </li>
        <li>In the summer  </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-style: italic;">Note: pupils in grade 9 to 12 and continuing education (CE) pupils are eligible to enrol in this program</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Literacy and Numeracy for Parents and Guardians.  </li>
    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline;">
      <ul style="list-style: disc;">
        <li>During the school year outside of the regular school day  </li>
        <li>In the summer  </li>
        <li>During the day for Parents and Guardians or outside the school day</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Enrolment in these programs is upon recommendation by the principal of the pupil’s day school.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Literacy and Numeracy Program courses may be offered before school, during lunch or after the school day and/or on the weekends.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Schools and boards should be familiar with the official Ministry enrolment register instructions for continuing education programs. These instructions are updated annually on the Ministry’s site <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html">http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html</a>.  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Please be familiar with the <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment &gt; Enrolment register info</a> option in the student’s record. This will provide detailed information on the enrolment register(s) the student will appear on. Hint: on the FTE and/or ADE card in the student’s record, there’s a Details section that may be expanded to show info on how FTE/ADE is calculated, and how the student’s data impacts the register. Literacy and numeracy program classes are reported as ADE.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Set up classes that need to appear on the Register of Enrolment in the Literacy and Numeracy Program</h3>
  <p>There are no Ministry defined course codes for literacy and numeracy programs. A <a href="../setup/setup-class-courses.htm">course</a> will need to exist, using any course code that is appropriate for the board/school. It may be a generic LIT-NUM course, or it may incorporate the grade level of the students taking the course (e.g. LTNUM78). A class will need to be created for each unique group of students enrolled in a literacy and numeracy program.  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If a class is to appear in the Literacy and Numeracy Program register, it must be set up (<a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Setup &gt; Class info &gt; Classes</a>) as follows:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>The course offering type must be set to one of the following:</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Literacy and Numeracy for Parents/Guardians</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- 7/8 Literacy &amp; Numeracy – Adult</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- 7/8 Literacy &amp; Numeracy – Con Ed</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- 7/8 Literacy &amp; Numeracy – Fully High Credit</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- 7/8 Remedial Literacy &amp; Numeracy</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- 9/10 Literacy &amp; Numeracy – Adult</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- 9/10 Literacy &amp; Numeracy – Con Ed.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- 9/10 Literacy &amp; Numeracy – Fully High Credit</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- 9/10 Remedial Non-Credit Literacy &amp; Numeracy</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: If one teacher is teaching the same class to students in grade 7 or 8, as well as to parents,  continuing education students, adult students, and high school students who are fully high credit, 5 unique classes will be created so that each class has the appropriate course offering type. The classes may be grouped so that the teacher can enter attendance for all classes in one class list.</span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Set the time of day type to one of the following:</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- After School</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Before School/Lunch Time  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Later-Afternoon/Evening Program</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Summer</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Weekends</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Enter the most appropriate Delivery and Course delivery type</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <br />
    <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 435px;" />
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Since funding is based on attendance, make sure that the class schedule, start and end dates, and period times are accurate. <span>For students with the morning/afternoon method of attendance, the class start time will determine whether to use the student’s morning or afternoon attendance entry to populate this register (start time before noon will read AM attendance, and a start time after noon will read from the PM attendance). If the school has only 2 periods, the class should be set to either period 1 (attendance will read from the AM attendance) or period 2 (attendance will read from the PM attendance).</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Make sure each student’s add/drop dates are accurate (add date is the first day attending the class, drop date is the first date of non-attendance in the class).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Parents/Guardians enrolled in Literacy and Numeracy Programs</h3>
  <p>Adults who are parents or guardians of pupils enrolled in grades JK/K to 12 in a day school program may enrol in Literacy and Numeracy Programs if enrolment has been recommended by the principal of the pupil’s day school. Follow these steps for these parents:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Add the parent to the school offering the literacy and numeracy program for parents/guardians. Use <a href="../students/add-new-student.htm">Student tools &gt; Add new student</a>. Accurately record the parent’s name as it is to appear on the enrolment register. Entry date to this school should be set to the first day of the literacy and numeracy class. Any other required fields may need to be set but the contents of the fields are not important as this parent’s info will not be used in any Ministry reporting.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>From the parent’s student record, select <a href="../students/class-info-timetable.htm">Class info &gt; Timetable</a>. Edit the parent’s timetable and add the literacy and numeracy class.  Make sure the parent’s register of adds/drops shows that the student is enrolled in the class on the correct date (e.g. if you ‘add’ the class after the parent has attended classes, you will want to edit the class enrolment start date so that it reflects the date the parent actually started the class). <strong>Hint:</strong> use the More icon above the student’s timetable to access the Register option where all these dates are listed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>From the parent’s student record, select Enrolment &gt; Enrolment register info &gt; Register info (first card on the page). Select the edit icon and then check the box “This student is the parent/guardian of a student in another school”. This will enable the SELECT STUDENT button where you can select the parent’s child from any school in the board.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num-sel-stu.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:432px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When looking at the enrolment register info card, the parent will show the student’s name as shown here:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num-sel-stu1.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:300px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>All pupil info submitted to the Ministry will use the parent’s child info, rather than the parent’s info.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Teachers track classroom attendance</h3>
  <p>Teachers are responsible for taking accurate classroom attendance, just like any regular class. The class schedule, start/end dates, and the school’s calendar will define what dates the teacher is expected to take attendance.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Cancelled instructional sessions – Funded cancelled session “C”</h3>
  <p>Where an instructional session has been cancelled owing to exceptional circumstances (such as bad weather or an emergency) and the instructor is paid, the session will be recognized for funding purposes. These sessions are included in the total number of sessions recognized for funding. The funded cancelled session must be marked with a “C” on the register and the reason for the cancellation must be recorded. To cancel a funded session, follow these instructions:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Use Attendance &gt; Enter attendance &gt; Group Excursion.  Select the date and group of students (e.g. all students or a specific class).</li>
    <li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select the option select the option c Cancelled.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num1.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:522px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Record an attendance note describing the reason for the cancellation.</li>
    <li>Apply (save) the attendance for the group.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">Note: If the“C” session is rescheduled, the instructor should not be paid for the rescheduled session and the rescheduled session must not be included in the total number of sessions recognized for funding purposes. See Rescheduled instructional sessions.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Cancelled instructional sessions – Unfunded cancelled session “D”</h3>
  <p>Where an instructional session has been cancelled (I.e. the teacher is unavailable) and the instructor is not paid, the session will not be recognized for funding purposes. Do not include this session in the total number of sessions recognized for funding. The unfunded cancelled session must be marked with a “D” on the register and the reason for the cancellation must be recorded. To cancel an unfunded session, follow these instructions:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Use Attendance &gt; Enter attendance &gt; Group Excursion.  Select the date and group of students (e.g. a specific class).</li>
    <li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select the option select the option $ Cancelled Not Funded.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num2.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:521px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: If the “D” session is rescheduled, the instructor should be paid for the rescheduled session and the rescheduled session must be included in the total number of sessions recognized for funding purposes.</span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Rescheduled sessions  </h3>
  <p>If a new session is to be added to the class, typically the class end date is extended to accommodate the extra session. This is done using <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Setup &gt; Class info &gt; Classes</a>.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If the rescheduled session is due to a session that is given the code “C” (funded cancelled session), the instructor should not be paid for the rescheduled session and the rescheduled session must not be included in the total number of sessions recognized for funding purposes. To reschedule a session, and have it removed from the register, follow these instructions:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Use <a href="../attendance/att-enter-groupex.htm">Attendance &gt; Enter attendance &gt; Group/excursion</a>.  Select the date and group of students (e.g. All students or a specific class).</li>
    <li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select the option select the option ^ Non-instructional Day</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num3.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:529px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Record an attendance note describing the reason the class is removed from the register (e.g. rescheduled session for the mm/yyyy funded cancelled session due to weather).</li>
    <li>Apply (save) the attendance for the group.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Generate the Register of Enrolment in the Literacy and Numeracy Program</h3>
  <p>To access the register, select Ontario reporting &gt; Enrolment registers &gt; LIteracy &amp; numeracy program.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num-card.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:202px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The form will look like this:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num-sel-stu-main.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 616px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The list of classes will default any classes that are set up to appear on this register. You may limit the classes using the filters, or select an individual or range of classes to print. A separate register is generated for each selected class.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Select the Print button located at the bottom of the form. Once the report has been submitted to the task queue, you may leave this application or generate other reports. You will receive notification when your report is ready. Reports are saved in <a href="../setup/setup-file-manager.htm">file manager</a> under Provincial &gt; Enrolment registers.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">Hint: See previously created registers by selecting the folder icon to open file manager at this location.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The info generated on the register may also be exported in a CSV file by checking the option shown below. The CSV file will be generated along with the register report, as part of the submission to the task queue.   </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-course-grant-export.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 280px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Here is an example of the register report:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num-sel-stu-report.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:959px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The top of the report will include the register name, school year, class (course code &amp; section letter and course title).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num-sel-stu-reporttop.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:578px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For each pupil in the class, it will include the following info from the student’s record (in the Personal area):</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num-sel-stu-report1.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:949px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If a parent/guardian of student is enrolled in the class, the parent is registered into the SIS under their own name but they are linked with a student in a day school (as explained earlier). Since OENs are issued to the linked students, not the parents, the student info will automatically populate based on the parent’s linked student. The only exception is the column titled “Name of parent/guardian (for Lit/Num)” which will print the parent’s name (and the attendance data will be based on the parent’s attendance in the class).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The ‘Day school pupil’ column is populated with either FT (full-time), PT (part-time) or blank (student is not a day school pupil) based on the student’s field called ‘Con. Ed. Student type’ (in student record under <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment &gt; Enrolment register info</a>). All pupils of the board are funded and their attendance sessions are included in the non-credit ADE calculations, so this column may be ignored (it will be blank for regular day schools requiring access to continuing education registers since these students don’t have a Con. Ed. Student Type).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>FT appears if the student’s Con. Ed. Student Type is one of the following types:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Also Attends Day School (Full-time)</li>
    <li>Full-Time Day School (exclude from Register totals)</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>PT appears if the student’s Con. Ed. Student Type is one of the following types:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Also Attends Day School (Part-time)</li>
    <li>Part-time taking same course(s) in day school (exclude from register totals).</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Blank appears if the student’s Con. Ed. Student Type is:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Only Attends Con. Ed. School</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The ‘Residence Status’ column will show either POB (Pupil of the Board) or OP (Other Pupil). A student is considered an Other Pupil (OP) if their student board residence status does not use ministry code 01, 06, 07, or 09.  If a student is an “Other Pupil”, their sessions will not be recognized for funding.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For students also attending day school, the ‘Day School Address’ column will use the student’s origin school as recorded in the student’s record in Enrolment &gt; School enrolment.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>To the right of the student info it will show the student’s attendance at sessions. This info is based on the entry of attendance by the teachers. The dates are based on the setup of the class.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num-sel-stu-report2.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:711px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For each date, a blank will appear if the student is present. If the student was not present at the session, one of the following 4 codes will appear:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A      Pupil absence from a session</p>
  <p>—     Late admission or early withdrawal (based on the student’s class add/drop dates)</p>
  <p>C       Funded cancelled session</p>
  <p>D       Unfunded cancelled session</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>* if the student is absent 3 or more consecutive sessions, these absences are not funded (they are excluded from total). Cancelled sessions (“C” or “D”) do not ‘break’ the consecutive absent count. For example, if a student had 5 consecutive absences in a row (Sept 26 to Oct 15), as well as 3 consecutive absences on Jan 30, Feb 6 and Feb 11. The cancelled session on Feb 4 does not count as a consecutive absence, but it also does not break the count of consecutive absences. Therefore, if there was a possible 40 sessions that the student could attend, the school will receive funding for 32 sessions (40 - 5 - 3 = 32).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>After the student details page, a summary page is included with an area for the principal to certify the register.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-ereg-lit-num-sel-stu-report3.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 670px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The ‘Hours per session’ is based on the daily average minutes of instruction set up for the class (using Setup &gt; Class info &gt; Classes). This may be based on period times, or it may be manually entered directly into the daily average minutes of instruction field. The minutes will be converted to hours on this register.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The ‘Location of Course’ is only required if the location is different from the school.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Funding - OnSIS reporting of classes on the Literacy and Numeracy Registers</h3>
  <p>The funding allocation is based upon pupil attendance. Full-Time and Part-Time Day School Pupils Include pupils enrolled as Full-Time (FT) or Part-Time (PT) who have an enrolment record in a publicly funded elementary or secondary day school in that same academic year on this register. All FT and PT pupils taking Literacy and Numeracy courses are eligible for funding. Their attendance must be included in the total number of sessions recognized for funding used to calculate the equivalent ADE.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Continuing Education Pupils Note: Beginning in September 2018 - Continuing Education (CE) pupils may be included on this register. A CE pupil may also be a parent or guardian of a pupil enrolled in grades JK/K to 12 in a day school program for whom Literacy and Numeracy for Parents and Guardians has been recommended by the principal of the pupil’s day school. These CE pupils are eligible for funding at the Continuing Education funding rate and their attendance must be included in the total number of sessions recognized for funding used to calculate the equivalent ADE. Other Pupils Other Pupils (OP) are not eligible for funding for Literacy and Numeracy courses. Their attendance must not be included in the total number of sessions recognized for funding used to calculate the equivalent ADE.   </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Funding is based on the information submitted to OnSIS. Regular schools requiring continuing education registers should refer to <a href="on-onsis-ille-lit-num-info.htm">OnSIS &gt; Continuing education for day school &gt; IILE/Literacy &amp; numeracy</a>).</p>

  <h3>ADE calculations for classes on the Continuing Education Credit Courses registers</h3>
  <p>The calculation of the average daily enrolment (ADE) is calculated as follows:</p>
  <p>ADE = # of sessions recognized for funding x hours per session / 950</p>
  <p> </p>
