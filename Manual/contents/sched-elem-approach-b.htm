<h1><a id="Approach_B"></a>Approach B:  Classes are created using 
 the traditional setup of classes</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">With this approach, schools can use the 
 familiar set up classes to create all the classes for next school year. 
  Then the &#39;assign students to classes&#39; tools can quickly add the 
 classes to the student&#39;s timetables.  With this approach, student 
 timetables are never automatically updated to reflect the classes that 
 are assigned to the students in the homeroom. As new students are added 
 to the school and they are assigned to a homeroom, the student&#39;s timetable 
 will be empty until the classes are added. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<h4>B1. Prepare for next year</h4>
<p>The scheduling process beings with running the ‘initialize scheduling’ 
 process.  This process duplicates the school information from this 
 year, into the next year.  This makes re-entering last year&#39;s homerooms, 
 advisor groups, courses, classes, and semester/term/day/period information 
 unnecessary if they will be similar for the next year.  It also advances 
 the students’ next year grades. </p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/elemoverview1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:432px;" border="0"/></p>
<h4>B2. Setup classes</h4>
<p>A unique class should exist for each unique group of students that meet 
 for instruction in a subject taught by a teacher. The classes should be 
 adjusted to match next year&#39;s needs using <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Classes</a>. This may include:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Adding new classes</li>
	<li>Removing classes no longer needed</li>
	<li>Changing class teachers</li>
	<li>Changing class rooms </li>
	<li>Adjustments to the class schedule (when it&#39;s taught)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Often the actual schedule of when the subjects are taught is not formally 
 recorded in the SIS, allowing the teachers to teach subjects based on 
 their own schedules.  Sometimes, classes are formally scheduled to 
 avoid teacher and room conflicts (e.g. physical education, French, music). 
 When classes are formally scheduled, the schedule is determined manually 
 by the school and then is entered into the SIS.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Classes not formally scheduled into periods may be assigned a <a href="../setup/setup-class-sem-term-day-pd.htm#Unique_class_schedules">floater 
	 pattern</a> (a user-defined day/period pattern that has no periods 
	 selected).</li>
	<li>Classes scheduled into periods may be assigned to semester/term/day/period 
	 patterns, but often the schedule is random and creating unique patterns 
	 would be time-consuming.  In the set up of the class, it may 
	 be flagged as requiring a <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm#Special_schedule">special 
	 schedule</a> which then allows the user to select the specific semesters/terms 
	 and days/periods unique to that class.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If new rooms are added to the school next year, or rooms are no longer 
 available, adjust the table of rooms using <a href="../setup/setup-class-rm-printrm-tt.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Rooms</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the classes are set up, see an overall view of the teacher and 
 room timetables using the  <a href="sched-teacher-master-timetable.htm">Teacher 
 master timetable</a> and <a href="sched-room-master-timetable.htm">Room 
 master timetable</a> cards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/elemoverview2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:862px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>B3. Setup homerooms</h4>
<p>Elementary students are typically assigned into a homeroom and the homeroom 
 teacher is typically the teacher responsible for the core subjects. The 
 homeroom should be adjusted to match next year&#39;s needs using <a href="../setup/setup-class-hmrm.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Homerooms &gt; Homerooms</a>. This may include:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Adding new homerooms</li>
	<li>Removing homerooms no longer needed</li>
	<li>Editing homerooom teacher(s)</li>
	<li>Editing room and designation info</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>B4. Assign students to homerooms</h3>
<p>Once the homerooms are set up correctly, the students should be assigned 
 into their next year&#39;s homerooms. There are many different options to 
 assist in assigning the student&#39;s next year&#39;s homerooms. These options 
 are more convenient than editing each student, one at a time, and there 
 should be one method that works well for your school.  Descriptions 
 of each option is provided on the card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homeroomsgd.htm">By grade</a> </p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-pd.htm">By period</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-class.htm">By class</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-hmrm.htm">By homeroom</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-random.htm">By random group</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-ind-gd.htm">Individual by grade</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-ind-hmrm.htm">Individual by homeroom</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If printed lists of the students in a homeroom are needed, use the <a href="../students/stu-reports-clist-hmrm.htm">Homeroom lists</a> card 
 to generate those reports.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/elemoverview3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1407px;" border="0"/></p>
<h4>B5. Assign students to classes </h4>
<p>Classes are typically added to students based on their homeroom, and 
 tools are available to add classes to the students in a specific homeroom 
 (or any other grouping of students (e.g. grade)). Note: these tools only 
 impact the group of students at the time the tool is run. New students 
 will need to have classes added directly in their timetable, or by running 
 these tools again.</p>
<p> </p>

	<li><a href="../students/assign-timetables-addclass.htm">Add classes</a></li>
	<li><a href="../students/assign-timetables-delclass.htm">Delete classes</a></li>
	<li><a href="../students/assign-timetables-cleartt.htm">Clear timetables</a> 
	 </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/elemoverview4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:646px;" border="0"/></p>
<h4>B6. Advisor groups </h4>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">If advisor groups are used, they should be 
 adjusted to match next year&#39;s needs using <a href="../setup/setup-class-advisors.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Advisor groups &gt; Advisor groups</a>. Advisor groups 
 are similar to homerooms where a room and teacher(s) is/are assigned to 
 the advisor group. The name of the group can be anything the school wants. 
 Some schools use advisor groups to indicate the guidance councilor assigned 
 to the student. Some schools have students meet regularly in groups where 
 the students meet with an advisory teacher to discuss general school related 
 topics.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">If advisor groups change from year to year, 
 there are many different options to assist in assigning the student&#39;s 
 next year&#39;s advisor groups. These options are more convenient than editing 
 each student, one at a time, and there should be one method that works 
 well for your school.  Descriptions of each option is provided on 
 the card.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p><a href="../students/advisor-group-by-grade.htm">By grade</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/advisor-group-by-class.htm">By class</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/advisor-group-by-advisor-group.htm">By advisor 
 group</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/advisor-group-ind-by-grade.htm">Individual by grade</a></p>
<p><a href="../students/advisor-group-ind-by-homeroom.htm">Individual by 
 homeroom</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If printed lists of the students in an advisor group are needed, use 
 the <a href="../students/stu-reports-clist-advisor.htm">Advisor group 
 lists</a> card to generate those reports.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img src="assets/images/elemoverview5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1393px;" border="0"/></p>
<h4>B7. Print timetables</h4>
<p>Printing timetables for <a href="../students/stu-reports-tt-stu-tt.htm">students</a>, 
 <a href="sched-print-teacher-tt.htm">teachers</a>, <a href="sched-print-room-timetable.htm">rooms</a> 
 is often not necessary in elementary schools, but the option is available 
 if needed. <a href="../students/stu-reports-clist-class.htm">Class lists</a> 
 are also available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/elemoverview8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:860px;" border="0"/></p>
<h3>B8. Year-end roll over</h3>
<p>The board/division/district is responsible for the actual <a href="Transfer_to_current.htm">Transfer 
 to current</a> process, however schools should make sure that they have 
 run the Archive attendance 
 &amp; achievement process. This process may be done at any time during 
 the scheduling process, as long as it is run after the current school 
 year is done and no further attendance or report card data is being entered. 
  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/elemoverview9.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:219px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Typically the roll over is done over the summer, before the students 
 start school again in the fall. It cannot be run before the current school 
 year is finished (e.g. it cannot be done in June), nor can it be run when 
 the school still needs the current year&#39;s info for reporting and other 
 processes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The transfer to current process takes all the &#39;next year&#39; info and copies 
 it into &#39;this year&#39;. This info includes:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>courses</li>
	<li>classes</li>
	<li>rooms</li>
	<li>timetables</li>
	<li>students&#39; grades, homerooms and advisor groups</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Student who are no longer returning to the school become past students, 
 and all other students are assigned the school year status of &#39;this year 
 and next year&#39;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once the 
 school has transferred to current, there should be no further use of the 
 Scheduling next year options.  All changes to data need to be done 
 to the &#39;this year&#39; info.</span></p>
