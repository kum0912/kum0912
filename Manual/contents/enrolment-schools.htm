<p> </p>
<h3><a id="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>
<p>The schools menu option is available for all students (past, present 
 and future students). Choose Enrolment &gt; Schools from the submenu.</p>
  
<br/><img src="assets/images/enrolment-schools1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:242px;" border="0"/> 
<br/>  
<p>You will see one or both of these 2 cards. Schools, and Requests for 
 concurrent enrolment.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Schools"></a>Schools</h2>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Schools</span> card shows a record 
 of the student’s schooling at this board/division/district. All students 
 will have this card, and the contents of the card will be the same for 
 all schools. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Schools card contains a chronological list of all the schools in 
 which this student has been enrolled at in your board/division/district. 
 Each school on this list will have access to this student’s record. If 
 a student returns to a school after a period of non-enrolment at that 
 school, a new entry (row) will appear for each time the student returns 
 to the school . </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The information is not editable because it is automatically obtained 
 from the contents of the student’s entry/exit info at each school. If 
 edits are needed, access the student’s record from the school, then choose 
 Enrolment &gt; Student enrolment submenu option.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><a href="enrolment-students.htm">See Enrolment &gt; Student enrolment</a> 
 for additional info on the contents of this Schools card.</p>
<h3><a id="Requests_for_concurrent_enrolment"></a>Requests for concurrent 
 enrolment</h3>
<p>The<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Requests for concurrent enrolment</span> 
 card is only available to those students where this school is the edsembli 
 record owner. Students who attended the school in previous years (past 
 students) do not have this card either. You can use this card when a student 
 wants to register at another school (e.g. typically summer school) but 
 the edsembli record owner will remain the home school. It is simply a 
 location to request enrolment at another school in the board/division, 
 so that the other school can see the request and accept the student’s 
 enrolment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/enrolment-schools3a.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:910px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>To add a concurrent request, select the Add icon in the tool bar. 
	 Enter the name of the school where the student wants to enroll. Those 
	 schools in your board/division (other than the home school) matching 
	 the entered text will appear.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/enrolment-schools3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:448px;" border="0"/> 
 `</p>
  
<ol start="2" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Select the school. </li>
</ol>
  
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/enrolment-schools4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:452px;" border="0"/> 
 </p>
  
<ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Select SAVE and the Request for concurrent enrolment card will 
	 appear.</li>
</ol>
  
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/enrolment-schools5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:624px;" border="0"/> 
 </p>
  
<p>The school can now enrol this student at their school using <a href="enrol-from-this-board.htm">Student 
 tools &gt; Add student &gt; Enrol students from this board.</a> When the 
 student is enrolled at the other school, the request will be removed from 
 this card. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student no longer wants to request this registration at the other 
 school, you may remove the request by selecting the row with the request 
 and then selecting Discard: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/enrolment-schools6.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:391px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Note: If the student 
 were leaving this school to attend another school, this is not where the 
 request to register the student at another school is made. In those situations, 
 the student is leaving this school and therefore the destination school 
 would be available to indicate where the student is going to. These requests 
 appear on this card as well, however, they will be locked as they cannot 
 be edited (removed) from here.</span> </p>
