<h1>Achievement &gt; Marks &amp; comments &gt; Class marks &amp; comments</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Class marks &amp; comments option provides access to the mark and comment information for students in a class.  Teachers record marks and comments.  At this time, this information is ‘view only’ for the office users at this time, however edit functionality will be included in a later release.  </p>
<p>To access this option, select the Menu icon in the left corner, then select Achievement, then Marks &amp; comments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This will take you to the Marks and comments section where you will find the Class marks &amp; comments card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-mks-comms-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:190px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the GO button to access the Class marks &amp; comments interface.</p>
<p>The presentation of the marks and comments is driven by the report card setup, and report card setups can vary drastically between different schools and grade levels.  The board/division or school office is responsible for this setup so the terms and topics (columns) should be familiar.</p>
<p>Each class has its own set of terms, and each term is given a unique name. For example, the first report card period might be called Term 1, or November, or Report 1.  Each class also has its own set of topics (columns) and if needed, subtopics.  For example, an elementary school may have a topic called English with subtopics corresponding to curricular outcomes or generalized into subtopics such as Reading, Writing, Visual &amp; Oral Communication.  Many high schools classes may simply have one topic called Grade or Mark.</p>
<p>The features of Class marks &amp; comments is best illustrated through examples.</p>
<p>Example 1 – Class with a single topic and an official mark</p>
<p>This is an example of a class with a single topic called Mark.  It also has an Official mark.  The Official mark appears automatically in the last term for courses that will be recorded in the student’s completed courses (transcript).  The school defines which course grade levels require an official mark.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-1topic-official-mk.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:623px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Below is an example of the Report 1 term, where the official mark topic doesn’t appear, and mark cells are disabled because the term is locked by the school to prevent changes after report cards are issued.  This also illustrates some calculated marks that have been overwritten (yellow background), and the comment icon appears when the teacher has recorded a comment.  These features are explained further below.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/Report1term.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:474px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>The last class you viewed will be defaulted, and the class, title, and teacher(s) will appear in the tool bar as shown here:  </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-name.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:564px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>Use the class filter to change to a different class.  If easier, change the teacher filter first to reduce the list of classes to just those classes assigned to that specific teacher.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the term filter to change the display to show the students’ marks and comments for a different report card term, and use the topic filter to reduce the topics/subtopics displayed .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the teacher has set up markbooks to record classroom assessments for a topic, and if you have access to this markbook information, use the date filters to limit the markbook information to just the entries in the date range.  This date range will be defaulted to the last date range used and it will be retained as you move between classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If markbook information is available, then an additional + or – icon will appear beside the topic (called Mark in this example).</p>
<p>          </p>
<p>Select the Expand markbook icon to see the details recorded in the teacher’s markbook.  Select the Collapse markbook icon to hide the details of the markbook.  Teachers have full control over the setup of their markbooks, including the categories (e.g. Class work shown below), subcategories (not shown here), Assessment type, and markbook items.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scrolling to the left will present more markbook information, and you may expand/collapse sections as needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The marks may appear with no formatting (exactly as entered, or calculated if the teacher used markbooks), or with no decimals, one decimal, two decimals, or three decimals.  To change the display of the marks, see ______ more options below.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a markbook where the teacher is using sub-categories:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When weighting is used between terms, or when marks are automatically calculated based on markbook information, it is possible to overwrite the calculated mark with another mark based on the teacher’s professional assessment of a student’s learning.  If a mark is overwritten, it will appear with a yellow background, like the example below:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hover over the mark to see the calculated mark in the tool tip:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Example 2 – Topics, subtopics and comments</p>
<p>This example is showing 2 topics. The second topic (Language Arts 5) has subtopics corresponding to curricular outcomes.  When a topic has sub-topics, there is no mark/comment information at the topic level, but marks and comments are available for the subtopics.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This setup has a topic specifically for the comment (called Subject Comment). The comment icon will appear if the teacher has entered a comment:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the comment icon to see the comment, formatted according to the dimensions defined for the report card.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>If a comment is too long, the comment icon will include an exclamation mark, and the comment text would appear in red:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The setup also defines what type of marks are allowed for the term/topic.  Marks may be numeric and/or letters.  When letters are used, hover over the letter to see the meaning of that letter as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mark cells that are grey, indicate that the cell is locked to prevent the teachers from making further changes to the marks for that term.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The mark cell will appear with a white background if the term is unlocked (available for mark/comment entry).  No mark will appear if the teacher has not yet entered marks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Example 3 -  Topic Program Codes (e.g., IEP, IPP, ESL etc)</p>
<p>Topic program codes are part of the report card setup to identify students with unique or alternate programs such as IEP or IPP or AP, ESL or EAL, or any other codes that the school/board/division requires.  If the program code applies to the student, it will appear in the column with the topic/subtopic where it applies.  In this example, the topic program code IEP has been setup as a possible code that can be applied to students in the language arts 5 topic.  This student has been flagged as having the IEP code for term 1:</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>More options</p>
<p>There are additional options that may be used to change the display of the class mark information.  Use the More icon in the class’ card to access these additional features.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This will present the additional options as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select ‘Mark display’ to see formatting options for the marks.  The student’s marks will re-format automatically as you change between the different options.  Click anywhere outside the more options area to close it.</p>
<p>If the board/division/school has defined colours for each letter grade, and letter grades exist for the student, the ‘Display letter colour coding’ will cause the mark cells to turn the appropriate colour when a specific letter grade is recorded.</p>
