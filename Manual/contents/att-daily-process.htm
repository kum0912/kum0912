  <p><a href="#6">6. Repeat</a></p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2><a id="1"></a> 1. Enter attendance from phone calls/notes</h2>
  <p>Phone calls/notes regarding student attendance are entered by the school office on an individual student basis by selecting the Individual student card (<a href="att-enter-ind-stu.htm">Attendance &gt; Enter attendance &gt; Individual student</a>):</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att5.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 207px;" /></p>
  <p>  </p>
  <p>Select the GO button and then enter the student’s name using the standard select student form found in student records.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When the student is selected, the following information is available:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit attendance- today&#39;s date</span>: Today’s attendance is editable directly on this card as explained in <a href="att-common-features.htm#Edit_individual">Common features – Edit individual student’s attendance – morning/afternoon method</a> or <a href="att-common-features.htm#Edit_individual_by_period">Edit individual student’s attendance – by period method</a>. We suggest that you avoid using the attendance code <span style="font-weight: bold;">A – Absent</span> for absences where the reason for the absence is known.  Absent is typically reserved for unexplained absences.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As soon as this attendance information is entered by the office, it will appear on the teachers’ attendance pages so that they will know the reason for a student’s absence.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2><a id="2"></a> 2. Enter attendance for a group of students/excursions</h2>
  <p>The school office enters attendance for groups of students with known attendance such as field trips, sport events, and bus delays. Rather than entering attendance one student at a time, use the Group/excursion card in Enter attendance:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att6.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 202px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Select the GO button and then specify the following information:</p>
  <ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
    <li>Set the date. Today’s date will be defaulted, however, any date or date range may be selected.</li>
    <li>Select the group that requires attendance to be entered. It can be:</li>
  </ol>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- all students,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- students in a grade or homeroom or class or bus,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- students assigned a specific defined character, or</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">- students in a school defined excursion list.</p>
  <ol start="3" style="list-style: lower-roman;">
    <li>Select the attendance code and when it is to appear (am/pm or period(s)).</li>
    <li><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att7.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 23px;" />Check that you have the desired “Change attendance option” set. Select this icon to see the possible actions that can be taken when you attempt to apply attendance to a student who already has attendance entered.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="5" style="list-style: lower-roman;">
    <li>Select the APPLY button at the bottom of the page.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">Note: these steps will need to be repeated if the group of students contains students on both methods of attendance. If this situation applies, MORNING/AFTERNOON and BY PERIOD tabs will be visible.</p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
  <p>See <a href="att-enter-groupex.htm">Enter attendance – Group/excursion</a> for detailed information on this feature.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2><a id="3"></a> 3. Attendance in each classroom is entered</h2>
  <p>Teachers take attendance as soon as class begins. If teachers do not enter attendance from the classroom, attendance information is typically recorded on a printed class list (see Student reports &gt; Class lists &gt; <a href="../students/stu-reports-clist-class.htm">Class</a> or <a href="../students/stu-reports-clist-hmrm.htm">Homeroom</a> and these reports can include a monthly attendance entry grid). The class lists are delivered to the office for entry.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Regardless of who enters the attendance, the process is the same. The school office will use the Homeroom card if entering the information from a list of students in a homeroom, or the Class card if entering information from a list of students in a class. Elementary schools typically enter attendance by homeroom, while secondary schools typically enter attendance by class. Teachers enter attendance using edsembli CONNECT.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att8.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 420px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 0px;">Notes: </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>
      <p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 0px;">Some secondary schools take class and homeroom attendance because they track whether or not the student shows up for a homeroom period.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 0px;">The Homeroom card will not appear if all students have attendance recorded using the “by period” method, and the school does not take homeroom attendance.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Sometimes, schools have students meet for core subjects in the morning and attendance is entered by homeroom. The students go to different classes in the afternoon so afternoon attendance is entered by class rather than by homeroom.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att9.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:29px;" /> Even if all students are present, the teachers should go into the enter attendance area and select the Attendance taken icon.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Every effort has been made to make the entry of class/homeroom attendance easy, efficient, and powerful.  See <a href="att-common-features.htm#Bulk_apply">Bulk apply</a> to learn more about the “bulk apply” feature that allows the same attendance information to be applied to many students.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2><a id="4"></a> 4. Check that attendance has been taken for all classrooms</h2>
  <p>The office should check to see whether all teachers have taken attendance. Depending on whether attendance is entered by homeroom or by class, you would select the appropriate Homeroom or Class card as if you were entering attendance.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Here is an example showing the entry of attendance by class, showing period 1 classes. Note the list of period 1 classes shows classes that have attendance entered (Entered column shows Yes) and classes that have not had attendance entered (Entered column shows No).</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-9.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:692px;" /></p>
  <p>  </p>
  <p>The list of classes will always display the classes that have not yet had attendance taken today. There is an icon in the toolbar that will hide the classes that have Yes in the Entered column so that you only see those that are not entered. One of the following 2 icons will appear so select the icon to toggle between the 2 icons.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att11.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:27px;" /> List of classes/homerooms IS NOT showing those that have attendance already taken. This is the icon you want on the toolbar when checking to see if all teachers have entered attendance. Your list of classes/homerooms will be empty when all classrooms have had their attendance entered.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att12.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:25px;" /> List of classes/homerooms IS showing those that have attendance already taken along with the classes/homerooms that have not had their attendance entered.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">Note: Schools that take morning and afternoon attendance  will notice this icon on the toolbar:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att13.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:22px;" /> Reset attendance taken</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If your school repeats the attendance taking process in the afternoon, select this icon before teachers commence afternoon attendance. It will set the Entered column to No for all homerooms or classes.</p>
  <h2><a id="5"></a> 5. Examine unexplained absences/call home</h2>
  <p>As soon as attendance is entered, the office should examine the absent students, and then follow the appropriate school protocol for determining the reason for the student’s absence. For younger students with unexplained absences, most schools are required to contact the student’s family. Select the Absent students card (Attendance &gt; Call home &gt; Absent students).</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att14.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 205px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When the card is selected, it will automatically default to show today’s unexplained absences. An unexplained absence is an attendance entry of Absent with no reason provided. For example, students with the following attendance code examples would be excluded because you know the reason for their absence: ill, ill – cold, ill – flu, team event – football. Although we don’t recommend defining reasons for the Absent attendance code, if a school has defined Absent – ill, students with this code will be excluded because a reason is selected. The entry of student attendance always provides the ability to select an attendance code only or an attendance code with a reason (e.g. Absent or Absent – ill).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Here’s an example of the students with unexplained absences for the “by period” attendance method.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att15.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 1163px;" /></p>
  <p>  </p>
  <p>Use the ‘All absences’ option to see all students with any kind of attendance entry in any period or morning/afternoon. Students who are present all day (so far) are excluded.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As you examine the list of students, select a student to see additional information about that student. The following information will be available:</p>
  <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Today’s attendance - so you can quickly enter any new attendance information. If you find out the reason for the student’s absence, change the attendance code from Absent (without a reason) to any other attendance code or reason. This will mean that the student will no longer appear in the list of students with unexplained absences.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Contacts - so you can quickly see who you need to reach to find out why the student is not at school today.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Attendance notes – so you can see notes that have been entered in the past.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Attendance for the school year – so you can see the student’s attendance history for the school year.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">Hint: Use the NEXT button at the bottom of the page to go to the next student in the list.</p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
  <h2><a id="6"></a> 6. Repeat</h2>
  <p>Repeat steps 3 to 5 for each time attendance is taken (e.g. for period 2, period 3, etc or for the afternoon if required).</p>
