<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>The Class info option in a student’s record contains information related 
 to the courses, classes and teachers involved in the student’s education 
 during the current school year (this year) or the upcoming school year 
 (next year).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Past students do not have access to the Class info menu, however their 
 historical class information is available from the Achievement menu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Timetable menu option is located in the Class info submenu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:262px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Timetable option presents the student’s classes organized by periods, 
 days, terms and semesters. Each school’s setup defines the number of semesters, 
 terms in a semester, days in cycle, and periods per day. Each class offered 
 by the school is assigned to the appropriate semester(s), term(s), day(s) 
 and period(s) that correspond to where that class is taught. This information 
 is used to determine where the class appears in the student’s timetable. 
 If all classes in a student’s timetable are full year (scheduled for all 
 semesters), or if the school’s setup is 1 semester, any references to 
 semesters will be hidden. If all classes in a student’s timetable 
 are scheduled for all terms, or if the school’s setup is 1 term, any references 
 to terms will be hidden. If the student’s classes do not rotate between 
 days, all days will be combined rather than showing a timetable for day 
 1 and another timetable for day 2, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can view a student’s timetable in 3 formats:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Today</li>
	<li>Summary list</li>
	<li>Summary grid</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:620px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>See <a href="#Todays_timetable">Today’s timetable,</a> <a href="#Summary_grid_timetable">Summary 
 grid timetable</a>, and <a href="#Summary_list_timetable">Summary list 
 timetable</a> for details on each of these timetable views. The summary 
 grid is the defaulted view.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although you may see the student’s timetable in many different formats, 
 there are many common features shared between all the views as described 
 in <a href="#Common_features_of_timetables">Common features of timetables</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Selecting the Edit icon from any of the timetable views, shows one common 
 edit screen (class adds and drops) as described in <a href="#Editing_timetables_adding_and_dropping_classes">Editing 
 timetables</a>. Please make sure the school’s calendar date is set to 
 the correct date before adding and dropping classes from the student’s 
 timetable. If the student is starting a class after it has started, 
 this date will be used to determine when the student first attended the 
 class. If the student is dropping a class before it is finished, the date 
 will be used to determine the first date the student no longer showed 
 up for class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to viewing timetables, you can print a copy by clicking 
 the More icon and selecting the Print timetable option (or the Print floating 
 action button in the bottom right corner).See <a href="#Printing_Timetables">Printing 
 timetables</a> for more information.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Todays_timetable" id="Todays_timetable"></a>Today (Today’s 
 timetable)</h2>
<p>Today’s timetable view is the only timetable view available for students 
 who have withdrawn from the school, providing the ability to see the timetable 
 for any past date when the student would have had a timetable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This view will use the school’s calendar to determine today’s date. 
 The school’s calendar defines what semester, term and cycle day to consider 
 for each date. The student’s classes for each period will display, and 
 if the time is during the school day, the class the student is currently 
 attending is highlighted:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:697px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will see today&#39;s date by default, but you can change the date by 
 using the arrow buttons located on the left and right of today’s date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:693px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You may also select the date to access a calendar control to select 
 a specific date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The resulting timetable will consider the student’s entry and exit/retirement 
 dates to determine if the student is enrolled on that date. If the student 
 is not enrolled, or if the student has no classes on that date, a message 
 will appear stating “Student has no classes on this date”. If a student’s 
 school year status is withdrawn, this message will appear for today’s 
 date, however, you may go back to a previous date to see the student’s 
 timetable on a prior date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today’s timetable view will consider the dates on which a student added 
 or dropped a class so that the timetable is a true reflection of the student’s 
 classes on the date. See <a href="#Editing_timetables_adding_and_dropping_classes">Editing 
 timetables (adding and dropping classes)</a> for more information.</p>
<h2><a name="Summary_grid_timetable" id="Summary_grid_timetable"></a>Summary 
 grid timetable</h2>
<p>The Summary grid view is a traditional timetable view where the student’s 
 classes appear in blocks in the grid corresponding to where the class 
 is taught. This view is not available for students who have withdrawn 
 from the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each unique class will be colour-coded to show where the class rotates 
 if applicable. To add or remove colour use the palette icon to toggle 
 off and on colouring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time6.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:792px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student’s classes change at the start of a new semester and/or 
 term, then the timetable will appear on a unique card corresponding to 
 each semester and/or term. Use the Show more and Hide all icons in 
 the card tool bar to expand and collapse the cards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is also possible to filter the cards on the view using the drop down 
 semester, term and day filters located above the timetable cards. For 
 example, selecting just semester 1 from the drop down semester filter, 
 will hide all semester 2 and above cards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:491px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Summary_list_timetable" id="Summary_list_timetable"></a>Summary 
 list timetable</h2>
<p>The summary list view of the student’s timetable is similar to the Summary 
 grid view but the student’s classes are in list format with all the day 
 1 classes listed for each period, followed by the day 2 classes listed 
 for each period. The list format is better suited for view a student’s 
 timetable on smaller devices. This view is not available for students 
 who have withdrawn from the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just like the summary grid view, if the student’s classes change at 
 the start of a new semester and/or term, the timetable will appear on 
 a unique card corresponding to each semester and/or term. These cards 
 can be expanded and collapsed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:785px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Common_features_of_timetables" id="Common_features_of_timetables"></a>Common 
 features of timetables</h2>
<p>The school determines what semester(s), term(s), day(s), and period(s) 
 apply to each class. A class can appear in a student’s timetable as long 
 as semester, term and day information is defined (where applicable). Some 
 classes are assigned into ‘no period’ (e.g. period X or floater classes). 
 Classes that are not assigned into a period will appear after the regularly 
 scheduled classes. When editing the student’s timetable, these classes 
 are grouped together on their own card titled Additional classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The school’s setup defines the number of semesters, terms, days, periods, 
 and period start and end times. These attributes define the blocks 
 in the timetable, and the student’s classes are used to populate the blocks 
 in the timetable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each class, you&#39;ll see the following information:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Class</span>: 
 This is the class from the student’s timetable. Class (e.g. MAT9Ab) 
 is a combination of the course code (e.g. MAT9A in all caps) and the section 
 letter which is a lower case letter a to z (e.g. b in this example). In 
 the school’s classes table (e.g. the master timetable), a unique section 
 letter is used for each unique group of students that are taught the course.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Title</span>: The 
 title of the course.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Room</span>: 
 The room number where the class is taught. If a class is taught in multiple 
 rooms, where the room changes on different days, the room will appear 
 as M. Select the class to access the details option to see class 
 details including specific room information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Teacher</span>: 
 The teacher or teachers assigned to the class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each class in the timetable grid may be selected to see more details 
 based on the <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">setup of the class</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="This_Year_vs_Next_Year" id="This_Year_vs_Next_Year"></a>This 
 Year vs Next Year</h3>
<p>As shown below, when viewing the timetable in the &#39;summary list&#39; or 
 &#39;summary grid&#39; format, a tab strip will appear with up to 2 options:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time11.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:295px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>THIS YEAR will appear if the student is enrolled in ANY school in the 
 board/division/district during the current school year. NEXT YEAR 
 will appear if the student will be enrolled in ANY school in the board/division/district 
 in the upcoming school year. The student’s school year status at each 
 school determines whether or not a student is considered as attending 
 that school for this year and/or next year. School year statuses are recorded 
 in the student&#39;s record using <a href="enrolment-students.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Student enrolment</a>, and they are interpreted as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">This year 
 and next year</span>: student is considered as enrolled in the school 
 on the THIS YEAR and the NEXT YEAR tabs.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">This year 
 only</span>: student is considered as enrolled in the school on the 
 THIS YEAR tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Next year 
 only</span>: student is considered as enrolled in the school on the NEXT 
 YEAR tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Withdrawn</span>: 
 although the student is no longer enrolled in the school, the THIS YEAR 
 tab is available to see the student’s timetable for the days when the 
 student was enrolled.</p>
<p> </p>

<p <p="">Use the tab strip to navigate between the student’s timetable 
 for this year or next year. When both options  exist for the student, 
 it will default THIS YEAR. When viewing the student’s timetable using 
 the today format, it is always considering the student’s “this year” timetable 
 and therefore the tab strip is not applicable.</p>
<h3><a name="Students_concurrently_enrolled_in_more_than_1_school" id="Students_concurrently_enrolled_in_more_than_1_school"></a>Students 
 concurrently enrolled (enrolled in more than 1 school)</h3>
<p>For the selected school year (this or next), if the student is enrolled 
 in more than 1 school in that school year, the select schools drop down 
 will appear as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time12.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:508px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The drop down list will include the individual school names where the 
 student is/has/will be enrolled in for the selected school year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If all schools that the student is attending have the same school structure 
 (e.g. same number of semesters, terms, periods, and days), an “All schools” 
 option will be available and the timetable will be viewed with all the 
 schools combined into one timetable view.  If the school structures 
 are different, it will default this school’s timetable and the other schools 
 are available to view.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When editing the student’s timetable, if the school structures are the 
 same, the class from the other school will appear with a shaded background, 
 and they cannot be rescheduled or dropped by this school. This is an example 
 of a class taken at another school:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time12-1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:648px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Flex_CTS_and_continuous_entry_classes" id="Flex_CTS_and_continuous_entry_classes"></a>Flex, 
 CTS, and continuous entry classes</h3>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Some classes may include an icon to provide 
 a visual indication that the class may be one of these unique class types. 
 The icons, explained below, will provide a tool tip when the icon is hovered, 
 and may provide additional functionality when the icon is selected as 
 described here:</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><img src="assets/images/flex-icon.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:32px;" border="0"/><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Flex class (Alberta only)</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The class is considered a flex 
 class, which is a unique class type available for those schools offering 
 flex periods. The flex class is scheduled into the student’s timetable 
 and typically all students have the same flex period. Students can pick 
 what they want to take each flex period from a wide range of offerings 
 created by the teachers in the school (e.g. one teacher may offer extra 
 math help, one teacher may offer badminton in the gym, and another teacher 
 may offer a meditation class). The teacher offerings are unique for each 
 time a flex class is held throughout the school year, and each time the 
 student can choose something different to take. The flex class in the 
 course workload card is really a placeholder class. The icon indicates 
 that this class has unique flex class functionality in edsembli CONNECT 
 for teachers and students.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes12.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:29px;" border="0"/></span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">CTS class (Alberta only)</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The class is considered the master 
 class of a Career and Technology Studies course or a module class. Typically, 
 the CTS master class is scheduled into the timetable in a specific period, 
 and the student takes many modules as part of their course. The CTS module 
 classes are not scheduled into a period. HoveriHoveriHoveriHoveriHoveriHoveriHovering over the icon will indicate 
 whether it is a CTS master or CTS module. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes14a.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:29px;" border="0"/></span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Continuous entry class</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The class is considered a continuous 
 entry class, which means the student may start and complete the course 
 at their own pace. The student will have their own start and end times. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Editing_timetables_adding_and_dropping_classes" id="Editing_timetables_adding_and_dropping_classes"></a>Editing 
 timetables (adding and dropping classes)</h2>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: If the student’s school year 
 status is set to withdrawn, editing the timetable will not provide the 
 functionality to add and drop classes.</span> Instead, the Edit icon provides 
 the functionality to edit the register. See <a href="#Register_automatically_tracks_add_drop_dates">Register 
 automatically tracks add/drop dates</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the Edit icon in the tool bar if classes need to be added or dropped 
 from the student’s timetable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The edit timetable interface will present the timetable in a grid view, 
 listing the student’s classes in the first column, followed by columns 
 for each period in the first semester/term, followed by columns for the 
 next semester/term (if applicable) as shown below:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time21.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:795px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will see some coloured blocks, corresponding to the spots in the 
 timetable where the student is attending classes. For each coloured 
 block, you will see a number corresponding to the number of students in 
 that class. Other blocks may show a letter and number to let you 
 know that another class section of the same course is offered at that 
 time (section letter and class enrolment are provided should you be interested 
 in moving the student into that class). If an asterisk appears (e.g. b*29), 
 the school has other sections of that course at that same time (if it’s 
 not a coloured block, it will show the section with the lowest enrolment).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time22.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:992px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student has classes that are not assigned to any specific period 
 or day (e.g. period X or floater classes), they will appear in their own 
 card titled Additional Classes with an indication of the semester/terms 
 in which the classes are taught.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time23.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:644px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are many different ways to make changes to the student’s timetable, 
 described in the subsequent sections. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The student’s timetable is not officially saved until you actually click 
 the SAVE button. This allows you to try various changes to the student’s 
 timetable but revert back to the original timetable if you don’t like 
 the changes. See <a href="#Saving_timetable_edits_or_reverting_to_original_timetable">Saving 
 timetable edits or reverting to original timetables</a> for more information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Selecting a class from the first column of the grid (under the Course 
 column) will present a menu of additional options. These options, if applicable, 
 will appear:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Class details</span>: Provides 
 additional information (the information may vary depending on whether 
 you are selecting a class or a course. It will present the details just 
 like you would see in the setup of the class or course (when you row click 
 a class or course in Setup &gt; Class info &gt; <a href="../setup/setup-class-courses.htm">Courses</a> 
 or <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Classes</a>).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Drop</span>: Drops 
 the class from the student’s timetable.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dual enrolment: 
 </span>(Alberta only) Provides a yes/no field  to flag this class 
 as a dual enrolment (for reporting to PASI). Check the box if the student 
 is completing this class in partnership with a post-secondary institution.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Class specific 
 options</span>: See <a href="#Flex_CTS_and_continuous_entry_classes">Flex, 
 CTS, and continuous entry classes for additional options that may appear 
 for these class types</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Moving_student_to_different_classes_of_the_same_course" id="Moving_student_to_different_classes_of_the_same_course"></a>Moving 
 student to different classes of the same course</h3>
<p>The edit timetable grid is very powerful. You may simply click 
 on a block to move the student to a different section of a class as shown 
 here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time26.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:528px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you work on the student’s timetable, you may introduce conflicts. 
  A caution icon will appear beside any days that have conflicts and 
 when this icon appears, the student&#39;s timetable cannot be saved until 
 the conflict is resolved.:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time26-1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:180px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The conflicts will be clearly identified in red, as shown below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time27.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:602px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you select a block for a class with multiple sections in the period, 
 all the sections will be defaulted so that you can select any class from 
 the list as shown below:</p>
<p> </p>

<h3><a name="Saving_timetable_edits_or_reverting_to_original_timetable" id="Saving_timetable_edits_or_reverting_to_original_timetable"></a>Saving 
 timetable edits or reverting to original timetable</h3>
<p>The student’s timetable may not be saved if conflicts exist (red blocks 
 exist in the student’s timetable or the cuation icon appears in the Day 
 tabbed navigation). At the bottom of the page, the SAVE button will 
 be disabled. If the SAVE button is not available, and no red blocks appear, 
 make sure that you check for red by looking at all days, periods, semesters 
 and terms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The SAVE button must be selected to save the changes to the timetable 
 and leave the edit page.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At any point, the ORIGINAL button may be selected to undo all edits 
 to the timetable by exiting the timetable without making any changes.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Adding_a_new_class" id="Adding_a_new_class"></a>Adding a class</h2>
<p>Adding classes is typically done by typing in the class (course code 
 and section letter if known) or by typing in as much or as little of the 
 course code or typing in a key word from the course title (e.g. chemistry) 
 in the box that says “Add by typing class, course or title then select 
 from list&quot;” as shown below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time31.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:716px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Based on the characters you type in the box it will start building a 
 list of potential matches as shown below:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time32.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:699px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the selected list of matching courses and/or classes, select a 
 class if you know exactly the class you want to add to the student’s timetable, 
 or select the course (which is bolded) to see where it’s scheduled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a class is selected, it will add the class to the student’s timetable. 
 The class block will be red if the newly added class conflicts with existing 
 classes, and therefore additional changes must be made to the timetable 
 before it may be saved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a course is selected, the course will appear after the student’s 
 classes. Course rows are easily distinguished by the fact that they have 
 no section letter and the row is highlighted. Class section and class 
 size information appears in the blocks as shown below. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time33.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:668px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the course row, select a block with a class section to add the 
 student into that class. The course row will be replaced by a class row 
 that is repositioned in the list so that it appears in chronological order 
 by period, and the newly added class block will be coloured. If it is 
 red due to a conflict, additional changes must be made to the timetable.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Dropping_a_class" id="Dropping_a_class"></a>Dropping a class</h2>
<p>Selecting a class (or course) from the first column of the grid will 
 present a menu of additional options. Select the Drop option to remove 
 the class (or course) from the timetable grid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time33-2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:673px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Register_automatically_tracks_add_drop_dates" id="Register_automatically_tracks_add_drop_dates"></a>Timetable 
 Register</h2>
<p>When a student’s timetable is saved, any newly added or dropped classes 
 are automatically recorded in the register. The computer time is used 
 to record the “Last modified” date and time. The school’s calendar 
 date is used to determine if the student is adding a class after it has 
 started, or dropped before the class is finished. The register is only 
 showing information for this school’s timetable activity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The school’s calendar date is set to the correct date before adding 
 and dropping classes from the student’s timetable. If the student 
 is starting a class after it has started, this date will be used to determine 
 when the student first attended the class. If the student is dropping 
 a class before it is finished, this date will be used to determine the 
 first date the student no longer showed up for class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although this is done automatically, there are times when you may want 
 to see or edit the register add/drop dates. The register is accessed by 
 selecting the More menu to access additional options, including the Register 
 option as shown below:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time34.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:914px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>You will see the Register option on these tool bars in the student’s 
 record:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;">Class info, Classes</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;">Class info, Timetable</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;">Class info, Timetable, Edit timetable 
	 *</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>* Since add/drop dates are saved when the student’s timetable is saved, 
 selecting the Register option within edit timetable will first prompt 
 to save the timetable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example register:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-register1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1112px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following information is recorded in the register:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Last 
 modified</span>: This is the computer date and time when the class’ register 
 entry was last automatically modified. This field is not editable.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Class</span>: 
 The class being referenced. This field is not editable.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Class 
 enrolment date</span>: This is the first day of class for the student. The 
 class start date in the school’s classes table will appear unless the 
 student added the class after the class started.<br/>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Class 
 end date</span>: This is the last day of class for the student. This 
 field is not editable as it automatically populated base on the class 
 end date in the school’s classes table, or it is the school day before 
 the drop date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Drop 
 date</span>: When the class was dropped from the timetable, the school’s 
 calendar date was automatically used to record this date. It represents 
 the first day the student did not attend the class.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Semester/term</span>: 
 This is the semester/term pattern assigned to the class. Pattern names 
 are school defined but should be meaningful enough to provide information 
 as to when the class is/was taught.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Day/period</span>: 
 This is the day/period pattern assigned to the class.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Edit Register</h2>
<p>Select a register entry (e.g. row click) to edit the entry, if needed. 
 The date the student started the class (enrol date) may be entered (it 
 must be on or after the class start date). The drop date is only available 
 for classes that have been dropped from the student&#39;s timetable. The drop 
 date must be before the class end date. The end date field will automatically 
 adjust to the day before the drop date (the last date the student attended 
 classes).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time36.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:548px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alberta schools: Instructional minutes received is an optional field, 
 however, if the school wants to request funding for a dropped class, this 
 field must be populated (to help support the request for funding). This 
 field exists for dropped classes only. </p>
<h2>Delete register entry</h2>
<p>Register entries should only be deleted if the student never attended 
 a class. Use the delete icon (located in the tool bar when you edit the 
 register entry). Since it is not possible to add register entries (without 
 adding the class back into the student&#39;s timetable), caution is advised 
 when the delete action is used.</p>
<h2><a name="Editing_students_homeroom" id="Editing_students_homeroom"></a>Editing 
 student’s homeroom</h2>
<p>Many schools have a correlation between a class in the student’s timetable, 
 and the student’s homeroom. For example, if the student’s period 1 class 
 is in room 200 with Mr. Smith, the student’s homeroom teacher is Mr. Smith, 
 in room 200.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If timetable changes result in a change of the student’s homeroom. You 
 can easily change the homeroom on  the edit timetable page by selecting 
 the More FAB then selecting the Edit homeroom icon shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-time38.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:367px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Selecting this icon will take you directly into the edit interface of 
 the Grade info card, where grade, homeroom, advisor group and attendance 
 type (full time, part time) may be edited.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Editing_timetables_for_many_students" id="Editing_timetables_for_many_students"></a>Editing 
 timetables for many students</h3>
<p>Rather than editing students’ timetables one at a time through their 
 student record, there are tools that will assist schools. For example, 
 the scheduling functionality helps the school build their master timetable 
 and then automatically loads the students into classes based on their 
 course selections. Under the Student tools &gt; Timetables option, 
 there are tools that can automatically<a href="assign-timetables-addclass.htm"> 
 add</a> or <a href="assign-timetables-delclass.htm">drop</a> classes from 
 a group of students, and tools to <a href="assign-timetables-cleartt.htm">remove</a> 
 all classes in the timetable. </p>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;"> </p>
<h2 style="color: #ff00ff;"><a name="Course_selections" id="Course_selections"></a><span style="color: #000000;">Show/hide unscheduled course selections</span></h2>
<p style="color: #000000;">There are times when you may want to see the 
 student’s <a href="stu-class-info-course-selections.htm">course selections</a> 
 that are not scheduled into the student’s timetable. When the course selections 
 are visible, the student’s preferred course selections that did not get 
 into the student’s timetable will appear as courses at the bottom of the 
 timetable grid. Here are a couple of situations where this feature is 
 beneficial:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li style="color: #000000;"><p style="color: #000000;">If the school 
	 transferred to the new school year without resolving all the conflicts, 
	 you can look at this year’s timetable along with the unscheduled course 
	 selections, thereby providing all the functionality to continue manually 
	 adjusting the student’s timetable in the current year.</p></li>
	<li style="color: #000000;"><p style="color: #000000;">During the scheduling 
	 process when working with the next year’s timetable, if the tool that 
	 automatically creates student timetables (load students) will not 
	 be run again, and there are conflicts that need to be resolved, one 
	 approach may be to look at the student’s next year’s timetable with 
	 the course selections visible. There are options in scheduling that 
	 go directly into edit next year&#39;s timetable with the unscheduled course 
	 selections showing automatically (under Scheduling next year &gt; 
	 Resolve student conflicts &gt; <a href="../scheduling/sched-resolve-stu-conflicts.htm">Students 
	 with conflicts</a> and <a href="../scheduling/sched-resolve-stu-conflicts-ind-stu.htm">Individual 
	 student</a>). </p></li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;"> </p>
<p style="color: #000000;">On the edit timetable tool bar, an icon will 
 appear to indicate whether the timetable is showing or hiding unscheduled 
 course selections. The tool tip will appear when you hover the icon, and 
 you simply select the icon to change between showing or hiding the unscheduled 
 course selections.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;"> </p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-style: normal;">Note: only preferred course 
 selections that have corresponding classes will appear. Alternate 
 course selections (e.g. courses that may be substituted with preferred 
 courses) will not appear. </p>
<p style="color: #000000;"> </p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Important 
 note about course selections and next year’s timetable edits</span>: Editing 
 next year’s timetable is not recommended until the school is finished 
 with any automated scheduling processes, specifically the load students 
 process. When the classes in a student’s timetable are changed in 
 such a manner that the student is now taking different courses than they 
 originally requested when they first provided the school their course 
 selections, it is important to know that the load students function will 
 completely rebuild the student’s timetable based on the course selections 
 only. For this reason, when a student’s next year’s timetable introduces 
 course changes, remember to update the student&#39;s course selections if 
 there is any possibility that the load students function will be run again.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"> </p>
<h2 style="color: #ff00ff;"><a name="Course_fees" id="Course_fees"></a><span style="color: #000000;">Course fees</span></h2>
<p style="color: #000000;">If a class is added to or deleted from a student’s 
 timetable and the class has an associated Course Fee (as defined in the 
 <a href="../setup/setup-class-courses.htm">setup of the course</a>), whenever 
 timetable changes are made, the course fees are taken into consideration 
 and refunds or course fees are automatically assigned (when appropriate). 
 Please note, the ‘Refund after (days)’ calculation depends upon the start 
 date of a class and the drop date within the student’s register and considers 
 active days in the school calendar. If the class was dropped after the 
 allotted refund period, the course fee will remain in the student&#39;s fees. For 
 second semester classes, the count of number of days begins at the beginning 
 of second semester. Use the <a href="stu-fees.htm">Fees</a> option in 
 the student&#39;s record to confirm that fees are applied/refunded appropriately.</p>
<h2 style="color: #000000;"><a name="Printing_Timetables" id="Printing_Timetables"></a>Printing 
 Timetables</h2>
<p>If a timetable needs to be printed, use the Print floating action button 
 located in the lower right corner when viewing the student&#39;s timetable. 
 Print is also available when editing the student&#39;s timetable, in the multi-FAB 
 button, however, it will prompt to save the timetable or discard changes 
 before it may be printed.</p>
