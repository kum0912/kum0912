  <hr align="center" style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" />
  <p>As batch files are created in the SIS, the data is validated based on business rules built into the SIS. As part of the <a href="on-sign-off-OnSIS.htm">sign off process</a>, the data will require validation in OnSIS, to validate the data against the OnSIS business rules, generating a list of errors and warnings. After validating the data in OnSIS, the sign off process includes the generation of a list of OnSIS generated verification reports. When the SIS verification reports and the OnSIS reports agree, you may confidently proceed with the school Sign Off in OnSIS.   </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Some of these reports are similar to the pre-OnSIS October/March statistical report (as available in the Verification reports option). As additional data was added to the OnSIS collections over the years, new verification reports were added in a newer format (as available using the More verification reports option).  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>By generating these verification reports in the SIS, the reports may be compared to the corresponding reports in OnSIS. Reports are available in both a summary format and a detail format. The summary reports show aggregate numbers and the detail reports the students reported in each of the totals. The <em>‘More verification reports’</em> show the details followed by the summary, all in the same report. The original <em>‘Verification reports’</em> show only the summary (by default) or the details (if selected), in separate reports.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Beyond the verification reports described here, you may also want to refer to the Ontario reporting options which includes many other reports that can be used to validate OnSIS data.</p>
  <h2>Verification reports</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Verification reports</strong> option generates a report similar to the pre-OnSIS October/March statistical report and it is available for the following OnSIS submissions:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>October elementary school</li>
    <li>October secondary school</li>
    <li>March elementary school</li>
    <li>March secondary school</li>
    <li>June elementary school</li>
    <li>June secondary school</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Choose OnSIS &gt; Reporting period &gt; Verification.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-verif-card.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 202px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Select the GO button on the Verification reports card to see this form:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-moreverif-main.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 767px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>By default, it will print the verification report, which is a multi-page summary report showing aggregate numbers, similar to the different sections on the legacy October School Report (e.g. Section B – Enrolment by Grade and Gender). Here is an example of the first page:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-verif-report1.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 718px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If the report option is changed to <em>‘Students in a specific section’</em>, you may generate the detail verification report for a specific section.   </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-moreverif-main1.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 766px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Select the desired report section and then select the Print button located at the bottom of the form. Once the report has been submitted to the task queue, you may leave this application or generate other reports. You will receive notification when your report is ready. Reports are saved in file manager under Provincial &gt; OnSIS &gt; Verification &gt; Submission period.  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The detail report will identify the names, along with the OEN, of all the students reported in each of the aggregate totals in the summary report.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>More verification reports</h2>
  <p>The <strong>More verification reports</strong> option is available for the following OnSIS submissions:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>October elementary school</li>
    <li>October secondary school</li>
    <li>March elementary school</li>
    <li>March secondary school</li>
    <li>June elementary school</li>
    <li>June secondary school</li>
    <li>Summer school  </li>
    <li>Night/continuing education school</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This option provides a list of reports that apply to the school for the specific submission period.  For example, elementary schools may only have access to the first 2 options below, but a secondary school will have access to all these verification reports:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>SAL</li>
    <li>Indigenous self- identification</li>
    <li>SHSM programs</li>
    <li>SHSM certifications  </li>
    <li>PLAR  </li>
    <li>Native studies</li>
    <li>Independent study enrolment details</li>
    <li>Dual credit course details</li>
    <li>Achievement in dual credit program by course code</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Select the GO button on the More verification reports card.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-moreverif-card.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 201px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This is the form that appears when the GO button is selected:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-verif-main.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:767px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Select the ‘create file’ box beside the report to be created. It will require the extracts just like the creation of the OnSIS batch files, and those extracts should already exist. Select the Print button located at the bottom of the form. Once the report has been submitted to the task queue, you may leave this application or generate other reports. You will receive notification when your report is ready. Reports are saved in file manager under Provincial &gt; OnSIS &gt; Verification &gt; Submission period.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Here are some examples of verification reports to illustrate how they provide detailed information about the students counted in each section of the OnSIS reports. For example, on the Indigenous self-identification report, the first part of the report shows the student details, and the end of the report shows the aggregate totals.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-verif-report2.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 722px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-verif-report3.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 717px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Here is an SHSM Program verification report:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-verif-report4.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 716px;" /></p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-verif-report5.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 714px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Here is a SHSM student summary verification report:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-verif-report6.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 718px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Here is an Independent study verification report:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-verif-report7.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 717px;" /></p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-verif-report8.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 714px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Here is an example of a continuing education verification report (available under <a href="on-coned-coned-ade.htm">Ontario reporting &gt; Continuing education &gt; Continuing education ADE</a>):</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/onsis-on-verif-report9.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 717px;" /></p>
