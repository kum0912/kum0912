<h3><a name="All_students_need_OENs" id="All_students_need_OENs"></a>All 
 students need OENs</h3>
<p>All publicly funded students should have a Ministry assigned Ontario 
 Education Number. All privately funded secondary student attending an 
 inspected Ontario secondary school also require OENs.  When OnSIS 
 collects elemental student data, the OEN is used to identify they student. 
 Private elementary schools report aggregate rather than elemental student 
 data because these students do not have OENs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Ontario reporting &gt; Ontario Education Numbers (OEN) option has 
 tools to assist with identifying students without OENs, requesting OENS 
 from the Ministry and importing those OENs into the students’ records:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="on-oen-students-no-oen.htm">Students without OENS</a></p>
<p><a href="on-oen-request-oens.htm">Request OENs from the Ministry</a></p>
<p><a href="on-import-oen.htm">Import OENs</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is also a tool to validate the OENs in the students records against 
 the OnSIS data, allowing OEN issues to be identified prior to submitting 
 data to OnSIS:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="on-oen-validate-oen-onsis.htm">Validate OENs in OnSIS</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Identify" id="Identify"></a>Identify potential OnSIS errors/warnings 
 at any time</h3>
<p>In preparation for OnSIS submissions, schools are encouraged to run 
 pre-validation reports to identify any errors/warnings that may be problematic 
 when submitting batch files to OnSIS. Use the Pre-validation option located 
 in each submission period to generate these reports.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Educators_must_be_updated_in_OnSIS" id="Educators_must_be_updated_in_OnSIS"></a>Educators 
 must be updated in OnSIS</h3>
<p>When creating batch files that include the teacher of the class, the 
 teacher’s MEN# in the SIS is used to identify the teacher in the file. 
 Every educator in the SIS must have a MEN# in their staff record. OnSIS 
 also requires the teacher’s position code in the batch file, and this 
 code must match the code in OnSIS.  By updating the educators in 
 OnSIS before getting extracts, the SIS can use the matching position code 
 found in the extract. See Update educators in OnSIS for more info.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Get_extract_files_from_OnSIS_before_submitting_batch_files" id="Get_extract_files_from_OnSIS_before_submitting_batch_files"></a>Get 
 extract files from OnSIS before submitting batch files</h3>
<p>Before creating any batch files in the SIS, extract files need to be 
 created in the Ministry’s OnSIS application, and these files need to be 
 saved in edsembli’s file manager. Extracts are used to determine whether 
 to send an add or update instruction in the batch file created by the 
 SIS.  See Get extracts for OnSIS for more info.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Setup_card" id="Setup_card"></a>Setup card  </h3>
<p>Each submission period includes a setup card. This card will provide 
 quick access to the file manager location where the OnSIS extracts, batch 
 files, and results files are stored for the submission.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Extract files</span>: these are the CSV 
 files that come from OnSIS. They provide info about the state of the OnSIS 
 data.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Batch files</span>:  these are the 
 XML files that the SIS creates. They provide add/update instructions so 
 that OnSIS can update their data to match the data in the SIS. These files 
 are created by the SIS and are uploaded to OnSIS for processing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Results files</span>: these are OUT files 
 that OnSIS creates when the batch files are processed. They provide info 
 about whether the file is processed successfully or with errors/warnings. 
 These files are downloaded from OnSIS and then processed by the SIS to 
 create an easy to read PDF file of the results.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select any of the folder icons to quickly access those files in file 
 manager.</p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/onsis2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:776px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The setup may also contain options that may influence the OnSIS batch 
 files, so it is good practice to check this option before starting any 
 new submission period. See Setup for more info.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Purge_check_boxes" id="Purge_check_boxes"></a>Purge check 
 boxes</h3>
<p>Purge check boxes appear when creating batch files. They are an important 
 concept to understand, and using them is the only way to send files again 
 using the original extracts. When the box is checked, an instruction is 
 included in the batch file to tell OnSIS to reset specific data in OnSIS 
 back to the state it was in when the submission period was first opened. 
 This ‘purge and prepopulate’ instruction is processed by OnSIS before 
 the contents of the batch file are processed. It does not return ALL the 
 data to its original form, but just the data in the section you are working 
 with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The purge box is generally selected if you are re-submitting a batch 
 file so that the contents of the previously submitted batch file are cleared, 
 and the data is reset for another attempt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/onsis3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:448px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the purge box is checked, you may notice the purge box automatically 
 checked for other file options as well.  Depending upon the file type, 
 other data may be impacted and automatically purged.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/onsis4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:425px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to better understand the purge process, it is important to 
 understand the relationship in the way the data is stored in the Ministry’s 
 OnSIS application.  Sometimes you will find references to Parent entries 
 vs Child entries.  Each student in OnSIS typically has a parent entry 
 and multiple child entries.  Unfortunately, the parent/child terminology 
 is a computing terminology and is not related to the student’s family 
 (OnSIS does not collect parental information).  The Parent refers to the 
 student, and the Child refers to different portions of data collected 
 for the student (e.g. class enrolment, special education, second language 
 data, etc are all “child”records). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you select a purge flag that affects a parent entry, it will automatically 
 affect the child entries as well.  If a student starts your school during 
 a submission period, the batch file will “add the student into OnSIS.  If 
 the student is enrolled in a second language program, a subsequent batch 
 file will add the second language program information into OnSIS.  If 
 you purge the student, the second language data will automatically be 
 removed as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Additional warnings will appear when these purge check boxes are selected 
 to clearly identify what data would be impacted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/onsis5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:692px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For elementary and secondary school submissions, there is a check box 
 to “Purge and Pre-populate ALL OnSIS data” which may be checked when creating 
 the Class List batch file.  If this box is selected, the entire submission 
 period is purged and pre-populated, enabling you to restart the entire 
 submission period over again.  Please note that this will remove any changes 
 made in OnSIS, including educator data that may have been updated manually 
 or submitted by another application (e.g. a HR system).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/onsis6.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:705px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Updating_data" id="Updating_data"></a>Updating data in OnSIS 
 using the ‘Create/Upload/Process’ cycle</h3>
<p>Data in OnSIS is updated through the process of creating batch files 
 in the SIS, uploading those batch files to OnSIS, and then processing 
 the results generated by OnSIS (analyzing the errors/warnings). These 
 3 basic steps are repeated until all the data is submitted and is accurate. 
 Since files need to be transferred between the SIS and OnSIS, the steps 
 may seem a little more complicated until you are comfortable uploading 
 and downloading files.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/onsis7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:715px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Step_1" id="Step_1"></a>Step 1:  In SIS, create batch 
 file</h3>
<p>Select the CREATE button on the cards to create the OnSIS batch files. 
 Submit the data in the order of the cards, and typically, wait until you 
 are finished working with the info on one card before moving to the next 
 card. For example, sending SHSM data (using the Other info option) before 
 the student exists in OnSIS will cause errors.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/onsis8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:774px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You&#39;ll see a similar form for each CREATE option.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/onsis9.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:776px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The board has access to the OnSIS functionality. Creating files with 
 multiple schools is recommended when the board does the OnSIS reporting 
 rather than the schools. Even though the file has multiple schools, the 
 OnSIS generated errors/warnings can also be parsed by schools when processing 
 the results file.  If creating the files from the board, the standard 
 ‘Selected schools’ card will appear at the bottom as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/onsis10.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:722px;" border="0"/>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the board creates the batch files, there is a check box to ‘Create 
 separate file for each selected school’. If this box is checked, it will 
 create PDF files for each school’s PDF report of warnings/errors.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After selecting the appropriate CREATE button, follow these steps to 
 create the file:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Check the Create file box beside the desired OnSIS batch file or 
	 files to be created. Although multiple batch files may be selected, 
	 where possible, one file will be created.</li>
	<li>If you have previously submitted this file to OnSIS, select the 
	 Purge box for the file(s).</li>
	<li>Examine the Notes column. Extract not found will appear if an extract 
	 is required but the extract has not been loaded into file manager. 
	 Hint: select the folder icon beside ‘location of extract files’ to 
	 see the extracts.  </li>
	<li>Set other options on the form as needed. Use the Help icon on each 
	 page for details on these options.</li>
	<li>Select the CREATE BATCH FILE option.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the report has been submitted to the task queue, you may leave 
 this application or generate other batch files. You will receive notification 
 when your file is ready. The created batch files are XML files, and they 
 will be saved in file manager under Provincial &gt; OnSIS &gt; Batch files 
 &gt; ‘name of submission period’ (e.g. March). Hint: quickly see the generated 
 files by selecting the folder icon beside ‘location of batch files’ on 
 the file creation form.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the batch file is created, a PDF file will also be generated if 
 any potential errors or warnings have been found. These reports provide 
 an opportunity to correct the data in the SIS before submitting the data. 
 After making corrections in the SIS, repeat step 1 (recreate the batch 
 file).  </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Download XML file</h4>
<p>Before files can be submitted to OnSIS, they need to be downloaded from 
 file manager in the SIS. Follow these instructions to download a batch 
 file(s) to a secure location on your local network.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Select File Manager (from the main menu). Hint: you can click the 
	 folder icon on the Create batch file form or on the Setup option (to 
	 open file manager at the correct location so you can skip step 2).</li>
	<li>From the Location card, open the folder tree to Provincial &gt; 
	 OnSIS &gt; Batch files &gt; October (or the submission period you 
	 are working on).  The Files card will show this location along 
	 with the files in this location.<br/>
	<br/>
	<img src="assets/images/onsis11.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:720px;" border="0"/><br/>
	</li>
	<li>Select (row click) the file to access the Download option.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img src="assets/images/onsis12.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:259px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The file will download based on your browser’s settings. Settings typically 
 control the location of the downloads and whether it asks where to save 
 each file before downloading.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Step_2" id="Step_2"></a>Step 2:  In OnSIS, upload batch 
 file  </h3>
<p>Once the files are downloaded from the SIS, they need to be submitted 
 (uploaded) into OnSIS by following these steps:</p>
<p>  </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Within the Ministry’s OnSIS application, go to Data Collection 
	 and then select the Upload Batch file under the School Data Submission 
	 area).<br/>
	<br/>
	<img src="assets/images/onsis13.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:602px;" border="0"/><br/>
	</li>
	<li>Click the Browse button to select the batch file created by the 
	 SIS.Typically, the Pre-scan option is not selected. If selected, you 
	 can see the errors that may be generated by the batch file, without 
	 actually having the contents of the batch file applied to the data 
	 in OnSIS.<br/>
	<br/>
	<img src="assets/images/onsis14.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:599px;" border="0"/></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Note any references to maximum size. Boards 
 creating batch files with multiple schools may need to zip the file prior 
 to submitting it.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Once you have browsed for the file (and it appears in the box), 
	 select the Submit File button. A message will appear indicating that 
	 it has been successfully submitted along with a button to upload another 
	 file.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Due to the confidential info in the batch files, consider removing 
	 the downloaded batch files from your local network. From the Ministry’s 
	 OnSIS applicaton, go to the Data Collection &gt; View/Download Batch 
	 Results (from the School Data Submission section). The batch files 
	 will appear along with the status of Queue, Processing, or Processed.<br/>
	<br/>
	<img src="assets/images/onsis15.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:596px;" border="0"/><br/>
	</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: the 
 status will not automatically update unless you refresh the page (press 
 F5) or select the option again from the menu. Depending on the volume 
 of submissions to the OnSIS site, it may take some time before the file 
 is processed. OnSIS will send an email message once the file is processed.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>When the file is processed, click on the file name (it is a link) 
	 to see a summary of the processing results:</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <img src="assets/images/onsis16.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:600px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page. Select the “Download Results” 
	 button, NOT the “Error details” button.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/onsis17.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:606px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-style: italic;">Note: Download results 
 button will save an OUT file. Error details button will save a HTML file 
 which is very paper intensive and does not provide the detail to assist 
 in resolving the error.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>When you select the Download results button, a prompt will appear 
	 to open or save the report. Select the Save button and make note of 
	 where you are saving the file.  If the file name does not end 
	 with OUT, cancel and make sure you have selected Download results, 
	 not Error Details.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/onsis18.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:520px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hint:  technical 
 users may open the OUT file and use CTRL &amp; F to search for RESULT&gt;F. 
 This will take you directly to the error, and you can see the contents 
 of each element in the file to assist in determining the source of the 
 error.</span>  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Step_3" id="Step_3"></a>Step 3: In SIS, process results</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Once a batch file has been submitted to OnSIS, the file will be ‘processed’ 
 by OnSIS. The results of this processing will be saved in an OUT file, 
 and it may contain important info about errors/warnings that should be 
 analyzed. By processing this file in the SIS, a report is generated that 
 clearly provides the results in a concise and easy to read format. If 
 multiple schools were included in the file, separate reports may be optionally 
 created for each school for distribution to the schools for data correction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">i. Add OUT file to file manager</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Select File Manager (from the main menu). Hint: you can click the 
	 folder icon on the form that appears when you select any PROCESS  button, 
	 or on the Setup option (to open file manager at the correct location 
	 so you can skip step 2).</li>
	<li>From the Location card, open the folder tree to Provincial &gt; 
	 OnSIS &gt; Results &gt; October (or the submission period you are 
	 working on).  The Files card will show this location along with 
	 the files (if any) in this location.<br/>
	<br/>
	<img src="assets/images/onsis19.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:866px;" border="0"/><br/>
	</li>
	<li>Select the Add icon in the Files app bar.</li>
	<li>Browse to find the OUT file downloaded from OnSIS, then open it. 
	 This will add the file to file manager.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/onsis20.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:900px;" border="0"/></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">ii. Process file</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Select the PROCESS RESULTS button located on any of the cards used 
	 to create the OnSIS batch files for this submission period.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/onsis8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:774px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The same form will be presented regardless 
 of which PROCESS RESULTS button was selected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Select the box beside the file to be processed.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>If the board is processing a file that contains multiple schools, 
	 select the option to Create individual PDF files for selected schools 
	 (handy if the results are being distributed to the schools for correction) 
	 or Create one PDF file selected schools.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Select the PROCESS RESULTS FILE button on the bottom bar.  Once 
	 the report has been submitted to the task queue, you may leave this 
	 application or process other result files. You will receive notification 
	 when your file is ready. The reports will be in PDF format, and they 
	 will be saved in file manager under Provincial &gt; OnSIS &gt; Results 
	 &gt; ‘name of submission period’ (e.g. March).  </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hint: quickly see the generated files by 
 selecting the folder icon on the form. As well, when the form is loaded, 
 if the file has a PDF, then it will appear on the form with a download 
 icon.<br/>

 control the location of the downloads and whether it asks where to save 
 each file before downloading.</p>

<p>Here are some example reports. Please note that the error messages are 
 provided by OnSIS, and the PDF files generated by the SIS are simply formatting 
 the errors returned from OnSIS.</p>

<h4>iv.  Fix data if needed</h4>
<p>Based on the results returned from OnSIS, make the needed corrections 
 to the data in the SIS. If you are unsure what to fix, from the Create 
 form of the batch file, access the help to see detailed descriptions of 
 what info is included in each field in the file. The fields (aka tags 
 in the xml file) will appear in the response file along with the error/warning. 
  Example fields are GRADE_TYPE, FTE, MINISTRY_DEFND_CRS.</p>

 submitting batch files  </h3>
<p>After all the data has been updated in OnSIS, all the errors and warnings 
 have been addressed to the best of your knowledge, you must log into OnSIS 
 and start the OnSIS sign-off process for the submission period.  The 
 school must sign-off and then the board must sign-off the school. The 
 sign-off process will run a validation report to ensure that the data 
 is error free, and will run verification reports that are checked to see 
 that numbers and totals are accurate.  The numbers in these OnSIS 
 generated reports should agree with the numbers generated in corresponding 
 reports in the SIS:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a href="on-onsis-verification-reports.htm">Verification 
 reports</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a href="on-onsis-verification-reports.htm">More 
 verification reports</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For more information on the sign-off process in OnSIS, see Sign-off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the sign-off process has completed, the data is locked in OnSIS 
 so that it may not be changed.  OnSIS provides a Request Data Correction 
 option, if a submission period needs to be re-opened.  Re-opened 
 submissions will need to go through the complete sign-off process again 
 after the data correction has been made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For most submission periods, the sign-off process represents the end 
 of the OnSIS submission period.  From the Ministry’s perspective, 
 the submission period is done, and the user has nothing further to do 
 until the next OnSIS submission period opens.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The October and March secondary school submission periods have one last 
 step to perform after signing-off. By doing this step immediately after 
 sign-off, the next onSIS submission period will avoid unnecessary errors.
