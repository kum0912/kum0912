<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Special education information is available for current, past and future 
 students, and is student-specific, which means the information is the 
 same regardless of the school that the student attends.  Only the 
 school that is the edsembli record owner can edit the student’s special 
 education information, however there may be school-specific custom fields 
 that may be edited by the non-record owner school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Students receiving special education may have their exceptionalities 
 recorded here.  The list of exceptionalities will differ between 
 provinces and schools, but some examples might include: gifted and talented, 
 visual disability, blindness, mild handicap, and severely disabled.  When 
 assigning exceptionalities to students, the list of possible exceptionalities 
 is based on a table defined by the board/division/district (<a href="../setup/setup-exceptionalities.htm">Setup 
 &gt; Special education &gt; Exceptionalities)</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Beyond the exceptionalities, there are many other user-defined tables 
 that require setting up if they are to be used at the school. There are 
 many sections to the special education area, and boards/divisions/districts/schools 
 may use these fields as they wish, however, some provincial reporting 
 requirements need specific fields recorded in the special education area 
 of the student&#39;s record. These provincial requirements will be indicated 
 in the documentation for these specific reports.  There are also <a href="../setup/setup-spec-ed-cf.htm">special 
 education custom fields</a> that may be set up to record any other information 
 that is not already provided for in the special education area.</p>
 <p> </p>
<p>Some schools have other applications that are used to track special 
 education information. It may be possible to directly link to that other 
 application from the student&#39;s record. An icon will appear in the Special 
 education page, and selecting the icon will open a new browser session 
 with that student&#39;s special education info in the other application. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Choose the Special education option in the student’s record.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><img src="assets/images/speced1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:269px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The special education page uses a tab navigation to move between areas 
 of the student&#39;s special education info. The tab options are<a href="#FILE_tab"> 
 FILE</a>, <a href="#MEETINGS_tab">MEETINGS</a> and <a href="#CUSTOM_FIELDS_tab">CUSTOM 
 FIELDS</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/speced7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:770px;" border="0"/> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="FILE_tab"></a>FILE tab</h3>
<p>The FILE tab contains 3 cards, as shown above, to group the info as 
 described below.  We suggest schools record the required fields for 
 provincial reports, as well as the student&#39;s exceptionalities. All other 
 info may be used however the board/division/district/school wishes.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">File details</span>:  Use 
 the Edit icon to enter this information. This is where students who are 
 on an individual education plan (IEP) should be flagged. The status should 
 be set to Active if the student&#39;s IEP is active.  All other fields 
 may be used as the board/division/district/school wishes. IPRC references 
 refer to Identification, Placement and Review Committee, and these fields 
 are all date fields. <a href="../setup/setup-spec-ed-progs.htm">Program</a>, 
 <a href="../setup/setup-support-serv.htm">Service</a> and <a href="../setup/setup-resources.htm">Resources</a> 
 are all based on user defined tables (see links for info on the setup 
 of these user-defined tables). </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Placements</span>: 
 For each placement assigned to a student, indicate the start date and 
 then select the student&#39;s <a href="../setup/setup-placement.htm">setting</a>,<a href="../setup/setup-placement-location.htm"> location</a> and <a href="../setup/setup-placement-status.htm">status</a> (see links for 
 info on  the setup of these user-defined tables).  End date, 
 accepted Y/N, and termination date may be optionally used as the school 
 wishes. Use the Add icon to add a placement. Select (row click) an existing 
 placement to access the edit option. If needed, the delete icon is available 
 in the edit interface.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/speced3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:614px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Exceptionalities</span>: 
  This is where the student&#39;s exceptionalities are recorded. Use the 
 Add icon to add an exceptionality. Select (row click) an existing exceptionality 
 to access the edit option. If needed, the delete icon is available in 
 the edit interface (but you should set an end date rather than delete 
 the exceptionality).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/speced2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:535px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student has an exceptionality, a start date must be entered. 
  If the exceptionality no longer applies to the student, an end date 
 should be recorded rather than discarding the exceptionality.  If 
 no dates exist, or if the dates indicate that the exceptionality is still 
 active, the student’s special education status will be considered active. 
  The special education icon will then appear in the student’s profile 
 area, where hovering over the icon will show a tool tip message indicating 
 the active exceptionalities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/speced8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:103px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: normal;">Note to Alberta schools only:  The 
 Exceptionalities card is also located as the last card on the Enrolment 
 &gt; Student enrolment option in the student&#39;s record.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="MEETINGS_tab"></a>MEETINGS tab</h3>
<p>The MEETINGS tab will show some of the pertinent File details from the 
 FILE tab, along with a new card for meetings. Meeting info may be used 
 however the board/division/district/school wishes.</p>
<p><br/>
<img src="assets/images/speced4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:761px;" border="0"/><br/>
<span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Meetings</span>: For each 
 meeting assigned to a student, indicate the date and select the meeting 
 type (initial or review) and, if applicable, the <a href="../setup/setup-committee-type.htm" style="background-color: Transparent;">committee</a> 
 (see link for info on  the setup of this user-defined table).  Date 
 waived, description, and  4 &#39;role&#39; fields may be used as the school 
 wishes. Use the Add icon to add a meeting. Select (row click) an existing 
 meeting to access the edit option. If needed, the delete icon is available 
 in the edit interface.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/speced5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:613px;" border="0"/></p>
<h3><a id="CUSTOM_FIELDS_tab"></a>CUSTOM FIELDS tab</h3>
<p>The CUSTOM FIELDS tab contains the board/division/district and school 
 user-defined fields specifically for special education. Fields are grouped 
 into cards corresponding to whether they were defined centrally (by the 
 board/division/district) or by the school.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/speced6.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1196px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the Edit icon to edit all the fields on the card, or select the 
 field (row click) to edit just that field. Boards/divisions/districts 
 may define fields as school or student-specific. If they are student-specific, 
 only the edsembli record owner school may edit these fields. If they are 
 school-specific, each school has their own value recorded for the student.
