<h1>Overview - Course selections</h1>
<p>After <a href="sched-initialize-scheduling.htm">Initialize next year</a> 
 has been run, the school can begin the process of collecting information 
 about the courses that the students would like to take next year.  The 
 school will use the students&#39; course selections to schedule classes and 
 to create the students’ new timetables for the new year.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before course selections are entered, the school updates the list of 
 courses available next school year.  New courses may need to be added 
 by the board/division/district first, if the course is to included in 
 the student&#39;s 
 completed courses (transcript).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Students can enter their course selections, or the school may enter 
 them individually or in bulk for groups of students with the same courses. 
  Once entered, course selections may be tallied and analyzed. If 
 the school determines that a course is to be cancelled, there are tools 
 to assist in changing the courses of the affected students.<br/>
<br/>
Each course that a student selects may be either a preferred course or 
 an alternate course:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>•<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Preferred  courses</span>:  These 
 are the courses that the student would prefer to have in their timetable 
 next year.</p>
<p>• <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternate courses</span>:  These 
 are the courses that the student would like to take if unable to get into 
 a preferred course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each preferred course has Y/N field for “Can this course be substituted 
 with an alternate?”.  The automatic process for creating the students’ 
 timetables (called <a href="sched-load-students.htm">Load students</a>) 
 has an option to allow automatic replacement of a preferred courses with 
 an alternate course rather than leave the student with a conflict in their 
 timetable. There may be some reports that refer to Mandatory, Elective, 
 or Alternate choices. Choices (aka course selections) that have N to this 
 question (no they can&#39;t be substituted) may be referred to as Mandatory, 
 and if they have Y to this question, they may be referred to as Elective.</p>
 <p> </p>
<p>If the school grants students access to edit course selections online, 
 the school may optionally lock specific courses so that they may not be 
 removed by the student.  Course selections are available to only 
 those students attending the school next year (<a href="../students/enrolment-students.htm">school 
 year status</a> is either ‘this year and next year’ or ‘next year only’). 
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These are the recommended steps for collecting and analyzing the students’ 
 course selections:</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Courses</span>:  Update the 
 list of courses that will be available to the students next year.  Add 
 new courses and remove courses that are no longer offered.  Every 
 course has a Y/N setting for ‘Display for student use during course selection?’ 
 so that the school may use courses for their own internal purposes.  See 
 Scheduling next year &gt; Course selections 
 &gt; Courses for details on this step.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Student course selections</span>: 
  Rather than entering the course selections for the students, often 
 the students record their own selections using edsembli CONNECT for students. 
 Other schools use third party career planning applications where students 
 record their selections and these selections are automatically imported 
 into the SIS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A student’s course selections may be edited by the office using the 
 <a href="../students/stu-class-info-course-selections.htm">Course selections 
 option in the student’s record</a> or by selecting <a href="sched-individual-student.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Course selections &gt; Individual student</a>.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tools exists to automatically add or remove a course selection for a 
 group of students, or to replace one course with a different course.  See 
 <a href="sched-add-delete-replace-course-selections.htm">Scheduling next 
 year &gt; Course selections &gt; Add/delete/replace course selections</a> 
 for details on this tool.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Analyze course selections</span>: 
 Once the course selections are added for the students, they may be analyzed 
 as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="sched-course-tally.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Course selections 
 &gt; Course tally</a>:  Use this report to list the courses along 
 with the number of students who have selected the course as one of their 
 preferred courses.  The course tally will help identify courses that 
 may have insufficient interest from the students that the course will 
 not be offered.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="sched-course-analysis-by-grade.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; 
 Course selections &gt; Course analysis by grade</a>:  Use this report 
 to list the courses along with the number of students who have selected 
 the course.  This report will help identify students who have selected 
 courses outside their grade level.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="sched-invalid-prerequisites.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; 
 Course selections &gt; Invalid prerequisites</a>: Use this report to identify 
 students who have selected a course but the student does not have the 
 prerequisite courses. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="sched-list-course-selections.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; 
 Course selections &gt;List course selections</a>:  Use this report 
 to see the number of course selections have been entered for each student. 
  This report will help identify students with too many or too few 
 courses.  The report also includes the actual course codes entered 
 for each student.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Counsel students if cancelling courses</span>: 
 Use <a href="sched-counselling-list.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Course 
 selections &gt; Counselling list</a> to see the names of the students 
 who have requested each course.  This report may be used by the school 
 if a course has insufficient interest that it will not be offered next 
 year and the guidance staff need to counsel the affected students.  The 
 report also provides the ability to jump directly into the student’s record 
 so that the course selections can be modified.  </p>
