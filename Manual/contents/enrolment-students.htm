<h2><br/>
<br/>
<a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>The Student enrolment option  in a student’s record contains information 
 related to the student’s enrolment in this school and this option is available 
 for all students: present, future and past.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You&#39;ll find the Student enrolment menu option in the Enrolment submenu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/enrolment1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:261px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Student enrolment is grouped and presented on separate cards titled 
 Student enrolment, School enrolment, and Enrolment reporting, as described 
 below. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Many fields in the Student enrolment 
 area show board defined values in drop down lists. Boards can add/expire 
 values in these tables using the options in Setup &gt; Demographics &amp; 
 enrolment. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="#Student_enrolment">Student enrolment</a>: This contains student-specific 
 enrolment data, which remains consistent regardless of the school. Information 
 contained on this card can only be edited by the edsembli record owner. 
 There are slight variations between provinces, but typically it contains 
 the following information:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>student numbers (school student number, provinical student numbers, 
	 other numbers if appropriate such as college/university application 
	 numbers in Ontario.</li>
	<li>record ownership to control which school can edit student-specific 
	 info (e.g. personal info that stays the same for all schools)</li>
	<li>Dates: when the record was first created in edsembli SIS, the student&#39;s 
	 entry date to elementary and secondary school, and the student&#39;s entry 
	 date to this board/division/district, </li>
	<li>A yes/no field to indicate the student has alternate programs (which 
	 will enable the alternate notes) </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="#School_enrolment">School enrolment</a>: This card contain 
 school-specific enrolment information such as entry/exit info for each 
 time the student enrolls and leaves this school. The info entered here 
 will not impact the student’s information at any other school. Students 
 may have more than one set of entry/exit dates if they return to the school 
 after a period of non-enrolment at the school. This is referred to as 
 &#39;previous enrolment&#39; (<a href="#Returning_students">see Returning  students</a>). 
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="#Enrolment_reporting">Enrolment reporting</a>: This card contains 
 info that is typically collected for provincial and other regulatory reporting. 
 In many cases, this information is used for funding purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Select_Schools" id="Select_Schools"></a>Select Schools</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">If the student’s record exists in other schools 
 use the drop down arrow to select a different school and see the other 
 school’s enrolment information. Since the student enrolment information 
 is the same for all schools, the ability to select a different school 
 is located after the Student enrolment card (above the School enrolment 
 card). All cards under the selected school will show the information for 
 that school.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img src="assets/images/sel-concurrent.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:327px;" border="0"/></p>
<h3><a name="Enrolment_tables" id="Enrolment_tables"></a>Enrolment tables</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Many enrolment fields use drop down lists 
 to select the student&#39;s value. These values are defined by the board/division/district 
 using the options under Setup &gt; Demographics &amp; enrolment. Although 
 every attempt will be made to keep these tables up-to-date in this manual, 
 please refer to the provincial tables for the most up to date information. 
 </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Alberta only: Links are also provided for 
 some PASI fields that will take you to an edsembli maintained page listing 
 PASI values. For the most accurate table values and rules, please consult 
 the official <a href="https://phoenix.edc.gov.ab.ca/login/default.asp" target="_blank">PASI site</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="Internal_transfers" id="Internal_transfers"></a>Internal transfers</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">As certain fields are changed for a student, 
 the date of the change is recorded in the internal transfers along with 
 the original and new values assigned to the student. These internal transfers 
 may be used when running reports on dates in the past where it is important 
 to report the value the student had on a prior date. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note 
 that internal transfers are related to the school and they are not recorded 
 when a student’s data is changed prior to attending the school (e.g. when 
 the edit is done before the student’s entry date to this school).</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img src="assets/images/internal-transfer.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:23px;" border="0"/> The internal transfers 
 icon will appear on all cards that include fields that are tracked in 
 the student&#39;s  internal transfers. Select the icon to see the student&#39;s 
 internal transfers (which are also available from the student&#39;s record 
 using <a href="enrolment-internal-transfers.htm">Enrolment &gt; Internal 
 transfers</a>).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<h2><a name="Student_enrolment" id="Student_enrolment"></a>Student enrolment</h2>
<p>The Student enrolment card contains student-specific enrolment information 
 that is the same regardless of which school the student attends. Only 
 the edsembli record holder can edit information contained on this card. 
  There may be slight variations to the fields on this card, depending 
 upon the province. Use the edit icon if changes are needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/enrolment3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:741px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style="margin-left: 0px;"> </h3>
<p>You can record the following information:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Alberta Student 
 Number (ASN):</span> (Alberta only) This is the Alberta provincially 
 assigned student number (9 digits formatted as ####-####-#). When PASI 
 is enabled, the ASN cannot be edited.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Ontario Education 
 Number (OEN)</span>: (Ontario only) This is the Ontario provincially assigned 
 student number (9 digits formatted as ###-###-###). See <a href="../ontario/on-oen-request-oens.htm">Ontario 
 reporting &gt; Ontario Education Numbers &gt; Request OENs from Ministry</a> 
 for more info. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Student number</span>: 
 This is the locally assigned student number. This number is assigned when 
 a student is entered into the edsembli SIS for the first time and follows 
 the student throughout his/her career at the board/division/district. 
  The numbers are determined by the board/division/district using 
 <a href="../setup/setup-student-numbers.htm">Setup &gt; Board &gt; Student 
 numbers</a>. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Ministry Identification 
 Number (MIN)</span>: (Ontario only) This field will only appear for Ontario 
 students who were enrolled in the school years ago when MIN numbers were 
 assigned prior to the introduction of OENs.They are formatted as ###-###-###, 
 </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">OUAC number</span>: 
 (Ontario only).  When a student has an application number for university, 
 it is recorded here (9 digits formatted as #########). The OUAC number 
 is really 11 characters long to accommodate with the first 4 characters 
 representing the year. Do not enter the first 2 characters into the field 
 (e.g. if the number is 20191234567, enter 191234567). We recommend that 
 a school record the student&#39;s application number as it is still used in 
 the OUAC reporting (see Ontario reporting &gt; Post secondary &gt; Send 
 info to OUAC for more info). </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">OCAS/OUAC SSSN:</span> 
 (Ontario only) This field is automatically populated with the student&#39;s 
 OEN. The school specific student number (SSSN) is sent in the files created 
 for the Ontario College Application Service (OCAS) and the Ontario Universities 
 Application Centre (OUAC), and the files will use this number (which is 
 the same as the student&#39;s OEN number). If for any reason the student&#39;s 
 OEN is changed, this field will not change so that any subsequent files 
 created for OCAS or OUAC will still retain the original number to reference 
 the student.  If OCAS or OUAC makes an inquiry about a student, they 
 will provide this number.  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">edsembli record 
 owner</span>: Student–specific data is stored once for each student even 
 when the student&#39;s record exists in multiple schools in the board/division/district. 
 One school is considered the edsembli record owner, and that school is 
 displayed here. The edsembli record owner is automatically calculated 
 based on the current date and the student’s entry and exit dates at each 
 school. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If this school is the edsembli record owner, 
 but another school should really be the record owner, it is recommended 
 that the student&#39;s entry and exit dates throughout the board/division/district 
 be reviewed. If it not an issue of data entry, then the Edit icon may 
 be used to switch the edsembli record owner switch from Yes to No. By 
 setting it to no, the next most appropriate school will automatically 
 become the record owner.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The edsembli record owner field will impact 
 the profile area of a student’s record. The profile will include one of 
 the following icons:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><img src="assets/images/record-owner-icon.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:22px;" border="0"/> The tool tip will show 
 &quot;This school is the edsembli record owner&quot;.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><img src="assets/images/not-record-owner-icon.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:23px;" border="0"/> 
 The tool tip will show &quot;This school is not the edsembli record owner. 
 Record owner is School Name&quot;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Date added 
 to edsembli</span>: This date is automatically recorded when the student 
 is first added into the SIS database. This date cannot be edited and is 
 for informational purposes only.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Entry to elementary</span>: 
 This is the date the student entered elementary school. This is typically 
 the date the student first officially started school. Some schools may 
 offer nursery school and for those students, this date may represent a 
 future date when the student is old enough to attend elementary school.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Entry to secondary</span>: 
 This is the date the student entered secondary or high school. This is 
 typically the date the student entered or will be entering grade 9 or 
 10, depending upon the province. This date is used in schools with both 
 elementary and secondary students (e.g. K to 12) to help determine whether 
 the student is included in distinct reports that may be unique for elementary 
 vs secondary students.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Entry to board/division</span>: 
 This is the date the student entered this school board/division/district.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Alternate programs</span>: 
  This is a Yes/No field to flag whether the student requires access 
 to alternate program notes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../alberta/PASI_Code_Values.html#Section23Eligibility" target="_blank"><span style="color: #007fff;">Section 
 23 eligibility</span> <img src="assets/images/opennew.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:20px;" border="0"/></a>:  (Alberta only). &quot;The 
 Section 23 eligibility code is used to identify students whose parents 
 have a legal right to have their child receive French instruction in accordance 
 with Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. 
 (<span style="font-style: italic;">PASI information Guide - Student and 
 Enrolment 2.0.pdf, 4.15 Section 23 Eligibility, p.54</span>). This code 
 refers to educational instruction in a francophone education program or 
 school and is not to be confused with French immersion. When a student 
 registers for school, Public, Separate, Charter and Francophone Authorities 
 are required to ask this question “Is this student eligible for French 
 instruction?” and the response is recorded here. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<h2><a id="School_enrolment"></a>School enrolment</h2>
<p>The School enrolment card contains information about the student’s enrolment 
 at this school. This includes status information along with entry (aka 
 origin) and exit (aka withdrawal/transfer/retirement) info. Students who 
 leave the school and then return at a later date will have multiple records 
 of origin and retirement information. The student’s current enrolment 
 information will be displayed first, followed by any <a href="#Previous_enrolment">previous 
 enrolment</a> information where applicable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/enrolment4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:811px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Alberta schools will see additional fields 
 in this area, as required for PASI.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><img src="assets/images/enrolment4-AB.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:836px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Use the Edit icon in the School enrolment 
 card if the info needs changes. The edit School enrolment form (shown 
 below) is divided into 3 areas: Overview, Current - entry info, and Current 
 - exit info (which is collapsed if exit info doesn&#39;t apply to the student). 
 Some provinces may see additional fields, as explained below, but these 
 fields are not shown in the image.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img src="assets/images/enrolment17.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:745px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;"><a name="OriginOverview" id="OriginOverview"></a>Overview</p>
<p style="color: #007fff;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">These are the fields in the Overview section 
 that apply to <span style="font-weight: bold;">all schools</span>:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">School year 
 status</span>: This status provides a quick way to organize students based 
 on when they are attending or have attended this school. Every student 
 is assigned a status reflective of the student’s enrolment at this school. 
 The following statuses are available:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<ul style="list-style: disc;">
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This 
		 year and next year</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> 
		 student is actively attending school this year and is scheduled 
		 to attend school next year. </p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This 
		 year only</span>: student is actively attending school this year 
		 but is not scheduled to attend this school next year. </p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Next 
		 year only</span>: student is attending this school next year (e.g. 
		 new to the school next year).</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;">Withdrawn: student was attending 
		 this school year but has withdrawn from this school (formerly 
		 referred to as Deleted). <span style="font-style: italic;">Alberta 
		 only:  Withdrawn students cannot have a registration status 
		 of active or registered.</span></p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Past</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> student attended the school 
		 in previous years.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The school year status is automatically updated 
 to ‘This year only’ for the students in the highest grade when the school 
 commences the scheduling process. The status is also automatically updated 
 to &#39;Past&#39; for those students who are not returning to the school when 
 the school rolls over to the new school year.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;"><span style="color: #007fff;">L</span>anguage</span>: This 
 language setting should be set correctly particularly if the school offers 
 multiple languages (e.g. bilingual schools). It provides a way to flag 
 students based on their language (e.g. English or French).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">These are the fields in the Overview section 
 that apply to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alberta schools only</span>:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Registration 
 status</span>: (Alberta only) One of these registration statuses is used 
 to identify the state of the student’s enrolment at the school:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<ul style="list-style: disc;">
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Active</span>: 
		 Registration record is for the current school year and the student 
		 is attending classes.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Withdrawn</span>: 
		 Registration was ended after the student attended classes but 
		 prior to the expected registration exit date. *</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Created 
		 In Error</span>: Registration was created in error.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Completed</span>: 
		 The registration has been ended as the student remained registered 
		 for the duration of the registration period.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Cancelled</span>: 
		 Registration was ended prior to the student attending classes. 
		 *</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Registered</span> 
		 : Registration record is for the current school year or upcoming 
		 year and the student is not yet attending classes</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Closed</span>: 
		 Registration was ended. This status can only be provided by PASI. 
		 *</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The registration status needs to be updated 
 when significant events occur that would cause the registration status 
 to change. For example, when the student starts to attend classes, the 
 registration status should be updated from Registered to Active.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">* Overnight an automated routine is run that 
 evaluates the registration status of all students.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If a student’s status is Past or Withdrawn, 
 their registration status must be either canceled, closed, completed, 
 created in error or withdrawn. If the registration status is something 
 else, the registration status will be automatically updated as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<ul style="list-style: disc;">
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;">If the status is withdrawn or 
		 if the student has been completely removed, registration status 
		 is set to canceled.</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-left: 0px;">If the status is Past, registration 
		 status is set to withdrawn.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Registration

<h3><a name="Previous_enrolment" id="Previous_enrolment"></a>Previous enrolment</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Students may have more than one set of entry/exit 
 dates if they return to the school after a period of non-enrolment at 
 the school. This is referred to as &#39;previous enrolment&#39; and this information 
 is automatically maintained when a student re-enrolls into a school (<a href="#Returning_students">see Returning  students</a> for additional 
 info on how this is done). </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Both current and previous enrolment info are

<h3 style="margin-left: 0px;"><a name="Returning_students" id="Returning_students"></a>Returning 
 students</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">The following information applies to those 
 students who have previously attended the school and have since returned 
 to the school. When a student returns to a school, you may add the student 
 as you would any other new student and the program will find the matching 
 student already in your records and you may proceed with the re-enrolment 
 through any of the add students processes. See <a href="add-new-student.htm">Add 
 new student</a>, <a href="enrol-from-this-board.htm">Enrol students from 
 this board/division</a>, and <a href="manage-online-reg.htm">Manage online 
 registrations</a> for more info.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Alternately, if you know that the student 
 is already in your current school year&#39;s  student records, you may 
 re-enroll the student by changing the student’s school year status (described 
 above) from Withdrawn to one of the returning status: This year and next 
 year, This year only, or Next year only. This will automatically move 
 entry/exit info into the previous enrolment card, enabling the most recent 
 entry info to be recorded in the &#39;current - entry info&#39; fields. If a past 
 student is returning, use Student tools &gt; Add new student.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Depending upon the selected grant program, additional fields may appear 
 based upon the province’s reporting requirements. For example, if grant 
 program code 230 (French as a second language) is assigned to a student, 
 the Hours of French field will automatically appear for the entry of the 
 number of hours of French instruction. This value is collected by PASI 
 to calculate the entitlement to Federal Government Funding for French 
 Language programs.</p>
