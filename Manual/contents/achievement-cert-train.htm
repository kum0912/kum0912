  <h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a> Overview</h2>
  <p>The Certificates, training &amp; awards option in a student’s record is an area where schools may choose to enter information pertaining to non-academic/professional courses and awards. In many instances, students take these certifications outside of school yet they still contribute to the overall student learning experience and portfolio. Many courses are related to professional training, such as first aid, CPR, lift truck safety, lab practices, fire safety, phone etiquette, safe food handling, WHMIS, etc. This information is available for current, past and future students, and is student-specific, which means the information is the same regardless of the school that the student attends. Only the school that is the edsembli record owner can edit this information.</p>
  <p>The Certificates, training &amp; awards option is available for current, past and future students in all schools. <a href="#Ontario_SHSM_students">Ontario students enrolled in a Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) program</a> will have their SHSM related certificates and training separated from any other certificates, training &amp; awards that are not part of the SHSM program.</p>
  <p>The Certificates, training &amp; awards  option is located in the Achievement sub-menu.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-cert-train1.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 306px;" /></p>
  <p>Once selected, the <a href="#Certificates_training">Certificates, training &amp; awards</a> card becomes available. For Ontario students enrolled in a SHSM program, 2 cards become available: <a href="#SHSM_Certificates_training">SHSM - Certificates &amp; training</a> and <a href="#SHSM_Other">Other certificates &amp; awards</a>.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2><a name="Certificates_training" id="Certificates_training"></a> Certificates, training &amp; awards</h2>
  <p>The Certificates, training &amp; awards card will list the student’s accomplishments in reverse chronological order.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-cert-train2.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 624px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Use the Add icon in the tool bar to add a new entry:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-cert-train3.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 463px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The following 3 fields are available:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date completed</span>: This is the date the student completed the training or the date the certificate was awarded.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Certificate/training/award</span>: This is the title of the certificate, training or award earned by the student. Select the certificate/training/award drop down arrow to see the list of all available certificates, training courses, and awards as defined by the board/division/district using Setup &gt; Graduation requirements &gt; Certificates, training &amp; awards.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Contact</span>: This is an optional field to record any additional text such as a contact name, business or location of the training, phone and/or email info.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>An entry must exist in the certificate/training/award field before you can save.</p>
  <p>To edit or remove an entry, select the entry from the card (row click to access the Edit option). On the edit screen you can make corrections and click Save, or select the Delete icon in the tool bar.</p>

  <h2><a id="Ontario_SHSM_students"></a> Ontario students enrolled in a Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) program</h2>
  <p>In Ontario, the Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) programs have very specific training requirements that must be fulfilled in addition to the course work required for the program. Information recorded in this area will be used to determine whether the student has met all the training/certification requirements. See<a href="achievement-grad-reqmts.htm"> Graduation requirements</a> for more information on setting up students in SHSM programs.</p>
  <p>When a student is enrolled in a SHSM program, they will see 2 cards (rather than the 1 card described above for certificates, training and awards):</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SHSM - Certificates &amp; training</span>: This card contains only the certificate/training values that are associated with the student&#39;s SHSM program.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other certificates &amp; awards</span>:  This card contains the certificate/training/award values that are not associated with the student&#39;s SHSM program.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The board setup of the SHSM requirements indicates the required and elective certificate/training requirements for each program and pathway. This setup is used to determine in which card to show the student&#39;s certificates, training and awards. Adding and editing functionality is the same as described above, however the list of allowable values is different for each card as explained below.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Hint: In the profile area, hover over the student&#39;s SHSM icon to see the student&#39;s SHSM program and pathway.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts-shsm6.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 203px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3><a id="SHSM_Certificates_training"></a> SHSM - Certificates &amp; training</h3>
  <p>This card contains only the certificate/training values that are associated with the student&#39;s SHSM program. This card is also located on the student&#39;s record in the graduation requirements options, when looking at the tab with the SHSM requirements for the student&#39;s selected SHSM program and pathway. </p>
  <p>Adding new values to the student will be limited to only those values associated with the student&#39;s SHSM program.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts-shsm4.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 840px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Use the SHSM certificates/training info icon to see the certificates and training values that are defined as requirements for the student&#39;s SHSM program and pathway.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts-shsm5.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 969px;" /></p>
  <h3><a id="SHSM_Other"></a> Other certificates &amp; awards</h3>
  <p>This card contains only the certificate/training/award values that are not associated with the student&#39;s SHSM program.  Adding new values to the student will be limited to only those values that are not associated with the student&#39;s SHSM program.</p>
