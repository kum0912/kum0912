<h1>Student records &gt; Achievement &gt; Marks &amp; comments</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Marks &amp; comments option in a student’s record is an area where 
 you can see all the marks and comments recorded for the student.  This 
 option is located in the Achievement submenu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="achievement/stu-rec-ach-menu.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:242px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A quick link to this option in a student&#39;s record is also provided from 
 the Achievement &gt; Marks and Comments option available from the main 
 menu.  If accessing this page from the Achievement menu, select the 
 GO button in the Individual marks &amp; comments card, then use the standard 
 select student form to select the student.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="achievement/ind-mks-comms-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:189px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Either method will take you to the Marks &amp; comments area of the 
 student&#39;s record to show mark and comment info from the current school 
 year.  Previous year info is available from the student&#39;s record 
 using <a href="prev-years-marks-comments.htm">Previous years &gt; Marks 
 &amp; comments</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Marks and comments are recorded by the teachers, and therefore edit 
 rights to this info should be granted to only those who can overwrite 
 teachers marks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The presentation of the student’s marks and comments is driven by the 
 report card setup, and report card setups can vary drastically between 
 different schools and grade levels.  The school office is responsible 
 for this setup so the terms (columns) and topics (rows) should be familiar 
 to the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A separate card will appear for each class (or homeroom) with terms 
 and topics. If the teacher is done mark entry for the class and have indicated 
 that the official marks are done, then the tool bar of the card will include 
 the student&#39;s official mark (e.g. the mark that will get added to the 
 student&#39;s completed courses (transcript)).</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><img src="achievement/stu-rec-ach-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:846px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The student’s current classes will be visible (their cards will be expanded 
 by default so you can see the report card marks), while the completed 
 and dropped classes will be hidden by default (their cards will be collapsed). 
  Use the Show more/Hide all icons on the card to expand and collapse 
 as needed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scroll down past the current classes, or collapse the Current classes 
 card for quick access to the cards containing Completed classes and Dropped 
 classes (if applicable to the student).  Expand the card to see the 
 classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:924px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each class has its own set of terms (columns) and each term is given 
 a unique name. For example, the first report card period might be called 
 Term 1, or November, or Report 1. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each class has its own set of topics (rows)  and if needed, subtopics 
 (rows).  For example, an elementary school may have a topic called 
 English with three subtopics called Reading, Writing, Visual &amp; Oral 
 Communication, whereas many high schools classes may simply have one topic 
 called Grade.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The features of Marks &amp; comments is best illustrated through examples.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Example 1 – Topics, subtopics and comments</h3>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:951px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The above example class has 3 terms (columns) and 2 topics (the first 
 2 rows).  The second topic has subtopics (indented rows) and therefore 
 there is no mark/comment information at the topic level, but they are 
 available for the subtopics.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the comment icon (above) to see the comment, formatted according 
 to the dimensions defined for the report card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:755px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>If a comment is too long, the comment icon will include an exclamation 
 mark, and the comment text would appear in red:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:45px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The setup also defines what type of marks are allowed for the term/topic. 
  Marks may be numeric and/or letters.  When letters are used, 
 hover over the letter to see the meaning of that letter as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main6.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:150px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This example also includes a subtopic that the office disabled for term 
 1.  This is represented by no cell in the first column of the second 
 subtopic here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:949px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mark cells that are grey, indicate that the cell is locked to prevent 
 the teachers from making further changes to the marks for that term.  The 
 mark cell will appear with a white background if the term is unlocked 
 (available for mark/comment entry).  No mark will appear if the teacher 
 has not yet entered marks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Example 2 – Markbooks</h3>
<p> <img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:954px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The above example has 2 terms and 1 topic.  When a term/topic has 
 both a mark and a comment, it will appear with the mark cell and the comment 
 icon. Select the comment icon to see the full comment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The mark may appear with no formatting (exactly as entered, or calculated 
 if the teacher used markbooks), or with no decimals, one decimal, two 
 decimals, or three decimals.  To change the display of the marks, 
 see <a href="#More_options">more options</a> below.  If a student 
 has a mark of 67.578, it would automatically round to 68 if no decimals 
 were displayed.:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the teacher has set up markbooks to record classroom assessments 
 for a topic, and if you have access to this markbook information, then 
 an additional + or – icon will appear beside the topic (called Mark in 
 this example).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main9.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:360px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the Expand markbook icon to see the details recorded in the teacher’s 
 markbook. Select the Collapse markbook icon to hide the details of the 
 markbook.  Teachers have full control over the setup of their markbooks, 
 including the categories (e.g. Essays and Assignments shown below), subcategories 
 (not shown here) and markbook items (the actual essays and assignments). 
  The denominator is shown by default, however weighting may also 
 be displayed (see <a href="#More_options" style="background-color: Transparent;">more 
 options</a> below).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main10.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:613px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When weighting is used between terms, or when marks are automatically 
 calculated based on markbook information, it is possible to overwrite 
 the calculated mark with another mark based on the teacher’s professional 
 assessment of a student’s learning.  If a mark is overwritten, it 
 will appear with a yellow background, like the example below:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main11.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:101px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hover over the mark to see the calculated mark in the tool tip:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main12.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:195px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Example 3 -  Topic Program Codes (e.g., IEP, IPP, etc)</h3>
<p>Topic program codes are part of the report card setup to identify students 
 with unique or alternate programs such as IEP or IPP, ESL or EAL, or any 
 other codes that the school/board/division/district requires.  If 
 the program code applies to the student, it will appear on the row with 
 the topic/subtopic where it applies.  In this example, the topic 
 program code IEP has been setup as a possible code that can be applied 
 to students in the language arts 5 topic.  This student has been 
 flagged as having the IEP code for all 3 terms, and therefore the title 
 ‘IEP’ appears for all terms in the first row.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main13.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:952px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="More_options"></a>More options</h3>
<p>There are additional options that may be used to change the display 
 of the information in the Marks &amp; comments area of the student’s record. 
  Use the More icon in the Marks &amp; comment card to access these 
 additional features.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main14.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:817px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This will present the additional options as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="achievement/more-menu.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:686px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select ‘Mark display’ to see formatting options for the marks.  The 
 student’s marks will re-format automatically as you change between the 
 different options.  Click anywhere outside the more options area 
 to close it.</p>
<p>If you select ‘Show markbook weights’, and there are markbook items, 
 the denominator and weight of the assessment will appear to the right 
 of the mark.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main15.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:771px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you select ‘Display letter colour coding’, and the board/division/school 
 has defined colours for each letter grade, and letter grades exist for 
 the student, setting this option will cause the mark cells to turn the 
 appropriate colour when a specific letter grade is recorded.</p>
<h2>Edit marks &amp; comments</h2>
<p>If you have rights, you can edit marks by clicking the edit icon in 
 the Marks &amp; comments tool bar.  This will allows marks to be 
 entered into the enabled cells, and when you select a comment icon, the 
 comment may be edited, then saved.  When all edits are done, select 
 the check mark in the tool bar to disable editing functionality to prevent 
 accidental edits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Select class tool bar to open class marks</h2>
<p>There may be times when you are looking at one student&#39;s marks and you 
 want to compare that student to others in the class. This is possible 
 by selecting the tool bar of the class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-rec-ach-main16.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:846px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you do this, it will open the class marks &amp; comments form for 
 the selected class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-view.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:932px;" border="0"/></p>
