<h1>Student records &gt; Fees</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify;

<p> </p>
<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>Every school collects money (funds) from students for various reasons. 
 Funds include all forms of payment, from cash to cheque to e-payments. 
  How these funds are collected and recorded may vary by school. edsembli 
 provides the tools to track student Fees. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The edsembli fees area is an excellent time saving feature that allows 
 schools to record financial transactions for both current and past students. 
 It has been designed as an Accounts Receivable system for students, and 
 beyond data entry, there are powerful reporting features. Schools are 
 strongly encouraged to involve their financial resources during the set 
 up process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fees are school-specific, however, with permissions, you may see the 
 fees recorded by another school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every student can have fees and payments tracked. The school creates 
 a list of fee types to broadly describe the type of fee.  Examples 
 might include course fee, bus fee, student activity fee, lock purchase. 
  When a fee is applied to a student, or group of students, the type 
 of fee is selected and an additional comment may be recorded if necessary 
 to help clarify the fee. As payments are made to the student’s account, 
 the payment is associated with the fee to track how much the student still 
 owes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Students may also have funds that are submitted to the school for deposits 
 on items they are borrowing from the school.  For example, some schools 
 require text book deposit funds that are collected at the start of the 
 course and the funds are returned to the student when they return the 
 text book to the school.  These student deposits may also be tracked 
 in edsembli SIS. The school creates a list of deposit fee types to 
 track the required deposits.  The payment of the funds by the student, 
 and the subsequent return of those funds are all tracked using the DEPOSITS 
 tab in the student’s fee area.  If no deposit fee types are defined 
 by the school, the DEPOSITS tab is unavailable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Students with outstanding account balances will have a fees icon in 
 their profile area.  Hovering over the icon will show the student’s 
 account balance (e.g. Account balance: $25.00).  If the student owes 
 money for both fees and deposits, the sum of both of these will appear 
 followed by a breakdown (e.g. Account balance: $35.00 ($25.00 fees + $10.00 
 deposits). This balance will also prominently display above the student’s 
 fee information when in that area of the student’s record, so you see 
 the overall balance regardless of whether you are looking at only fees 
 or only deposits. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this example the student has an Account balance credit of $18.00, 
 with nothing overdue.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>  </p>
<p>In addition to student fees and deposits, some schools may want to track 
 other school funds that are neither student-based nor associated to students. This 
 might include money submitted to the office for a school fund raiser, 
 or a corporate donation to the school, or money collected from the vending 
 machine. These funds are simply recorded for record-keeping purposes only; 
 no records are kept with respect to what happens to the funds after they 
 are collected. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before using fees, please take a moment to read the <a href="../fees/fees-important-concepts.htm">Important 
 concepts</a> section.</p>

<h2><a id="Summary_tab"></a>Summary tab</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>When looking at a student’s fees, this is a sample summary view (SUMMARY 
 tab) as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/fees-summary.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:795px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The summary view will be different for each student, depending upon 
 the status of the student’s accounts with the school.  The summary 
 may include up to 3 cards to convey the student’s account status: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Account balance card</span> (every 
	 student will have this)</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unpaid fees</span> card (appears 
	 only if the student has unpaid fees)</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Payment credits</span> card (appears 
	 only if the student has payment credits – money not associated with 
	 any fees). </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: the information in the summary may 
 include references to due dates.  Schools choose to track due dates 
 on every fee.  When a fee is not paid by the due date, it is considered 
 overdue. If a school does not track due dates, any area of fees references 
 to due dates or overdue unpaid fees will be disabled.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="Account_balance"></a>Account balance </h3>
<p>Every student will have an Account balance card on the SUMMARY tab. 
 The student’s account balance will be displayed in the app bar. The 
 student’s account balance represents the amount of money the student owes 
 the school.  This may be due to unpaid fees or deposits required 
 by the school.  The student’s account balance is displayed above 
 the student’s fee information as shown below, so you see the overall balance 
 regardless of whether you are looking at only fees or only deposits.  If 
 no deposits money is unpaid, it will just show how much the student owes. 
  In this example, the student has $15.00 in outstanding fees:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/fees-account-balance-owing.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:574px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student has paid more than he/she owes, the balance will be a 
 negative number and will appear with brackets, as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/fees-account-balance-overpay.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:575px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Account balance card may have slight variations by student.  Here 
 are some examples:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• Student has paid all fees and has an account balance of zero</p>
<p>• School uses due dates, and the student has unpaid fees. Some of the 
 unpaid fees are overdue, and some are not yet overdue</p>
<p>• School does not use due dates, and the student has outstanding fees 
 and no payment credits:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="Unpaid_fees"></a>Unpaid fees</h3>
<p>The Unpaid fees card will only appear if the student has fees that are 
 not yet paid (i.e. outstanding fees).  The card will list the student’s 
 fees with balances greater than zero (e.g. unpaid fees).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/fees-unpaid.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:771px;" border="0"/></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Fees that have been paid can be seen in the 
 TRANSACTIONS tab which lists all activity with respect to the student’s 
 fees (fees, payments, refunds, deposits, and reversals due to NSF).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<h2><a id="Payment_credits"></a>Payment credits </h2>
<p>The card titled Payment credits (shown below) will only appear if the 
 student has money in the account, but that money is not applied to any 
 fee. This typically only happens if payments were made prior to the fees 
 being applied to the student, a course fee was returned, or an overpayment 
 of a fee was made so there is extra money in the student’s account.</p>
<p> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Deposits_tab"></a>Deposits tab</h2>
<p>If the school has set up deposit fee types, every student will have 
 access to a DEPOSITS tab, where deposit information can be tracked. This 
 includes adding a deposit fee (to indicate that a deposit is required), 
 making a deposit payment (when the deposit funds are submitted), and refunding 
 the deposit (when the deposit is no longer required).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>See <a href="../fees/fees-deposits.htm">Deposits</a> in the Fees section 
 of the manual.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Deposit balance card</h3>
<p>The student’s deposit account balance will be displayed in the tool 
 bar. In this example, the student has not yet paid the $12 deposit and 
 has a Deposit balance of $12.00 in outstanding deposits to pay.</p>
<h3>Deposits card</h3>
<p>The Deposits card shows the deposit history including Date, Due, Fee 
 type, Invoice number, Deposit required (amount), Payment (if any), Balance 
 (if any) and Comments (if any).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Row clicking a deposit lets you view Details, Add, Edit and Refund a 
 deposit, as well as convert the deposit in to a credit if a refund is 
 not wanted. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Fee_transactions_tab"></a>Fee transactions tab</h2>
