<h1>Student records &gt; Lockers</h1>
 <hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
								 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; 
								 orphans: auto; text-align: justify; widows: 1; 
								 -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<p>The Locker option in a student’s record provides easy access to the 
 student’s locker information.  Locker information is available for 
 current and future students only.  Students have one locker so the 
 re-assignment of lockers for the next school year should not be done until 
 the current school year is finished. If a student is concurrently enrolled 
 in multiple schools, locker information may be recorded at each school. 
  Some schools opt to record only the student&#39;s locker number if the 
 effort in maintaining accurate lock info does not provide significant 
 benefit.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before a school may begin recording locker information for the students, 
 there are some setup tasks that must be done.  For example, establishing 
 the lockers that are available to the students, and defining lock combinations 
 for school owned locks that are supplied to the students.  New schools 
 will often have this information imported to minimize the amount of data 
 entry required. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The student’s locker information is broken down into two main areas: 
  info about the locker and info about the lock.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Locker:  <span style="font-weight: normal;">Before 
 lockers are assigned to students, the lockers in the school must first 
 be defined.  Each locker is defined by a locker number, locker bank, 
 locker type, capacity (number of students using the locker), and whether 
 or not the lock is built into the locker.  As part of this setup, 
 lockers will default as ‘available’ but this should be changed if the 
 locker is not available (e.g. during renovations). </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">See Setup &gt; Lockers for information 
 on defining the school <a href="../setup/setup-locker-types.htm">locker 
 types</a>, <a href="../setup/setup-locker-banks.htm">locker banks</a>, 
 and <a href="../setup/setup-lockers.htm">lockers</a>. Locker types typically 
 describe the locker using names that are meaningful to the school (e.g. 
 Single, Half, Triple tier, Shared, Red, Blue, Double-width).  Locker 
 banks typically describe the location of the locker (e.g. Music Hall, 
 Tech Wing, 2nd Floor North Hall).  </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The locker setup is generally a one-time 
 process, and edsembli SIS provides the tools to quickly add ranges of 
 lockers.  </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lock</span>: 
  A lock is used to secure the student’s personal belongings in the 
 locker.  Depending upon the school, any of the following locks may 
 apply:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The lock is the student’s personal lock.  The lock owner is 
	 the student.  The lock is not built-in to the locker (e.g. the 
	 padlock can be taken off the locker and the student can take it home 
	 when they withdraw or graduate from the school).  Lock information 
	 is automatically removed when a student’s school year status changes 
	 to withdrawn or past.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The school supplies the lock to the student.  The student 
	 borrows the lock for one or many years. The lock owner is the school. 
	  The lock is not built-in to the locker (e.g. the padlock can 
	 be taken off the locker and stored elsewhere in the school when not 
	 on loan to a student). </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The lock is built-in to the locker. A built-in combination lock 
	 cannot be taken off the locker and used on a different locker. The 
	 lock is defined as part of the locker, and when a student is assign 
	 one of these lockers, lock information automatically appears.  A 
	 school or student owned lock cannot be used on these lockers. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Each lock will be defined by a type, serial number, and a combination. 
  If the lock is not built into the locker, it will have an owner 
 (either the school or the student).  Before lock information is recorded 
 for a student, the school creates a list of lock types (e.g. manufacturer 
 or description of the type of lock), as described in <a href="../setup/setup-locks.htm">Setup 
 &gt; Lockers &gt; Locks</a>.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the students are assigned new lockers each year, rather than editing 
 locker information one student at a time through student records, there 
 are some tools that may be helpful:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><a href="clear-lockers.htm">Student tools &gt; Lockers &gt; Clear 
	 lockers</a> will clear locker information for groups of students. 
	 This will make the lockers available to be assigned to other students. 
	 </li>
	<li><a href="assign-lockers.htm">Student tools &gt; Lockers &gt; Assign 
	 lockers</a> will assign lockers to a group of students.</li>
	<li><a href="assign-lockers.htm">Student tools &gt; Lockers &gt; Clear 
	 locks</a> will clear the school-owned lock info for a group of students. 
	 Use this if the students receive new school-owned locks each school 
	 year. Each student&#39;s new lock info would need to be entered as each 
	 new lock is distributed. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Access the student&#39;s locker info by choosing the Lockers option from 
 the student&#39;s record.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-locker1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:337px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student has no locker/lock info, use the Add icon in the locker 
 card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-locker4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:634px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student has locker/lock info, it will appear in the locker card. 
 The student&#39;s current locker number is also included in the card title 
 (e.g. this student is currently assigned to locker 0136).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-locker2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:890px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the Edit icon to edit the student&#39;s locker/lock info.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-locker3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:802px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following fields appear on the edit locker form:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Locker (locker # - locker bank - locker 
 type)</span>:  Select the student’s locker from the list of lockers 
 that are available.  The list will include lockers that are not yet 
 assigned to a student, and lockers that have capacity for another student 
 where lockers are setup for multiple students. The lockers are sorted 
 by locker number so you may type the locker number if easier. In addition 
 to the locker number, the locker bank and locker type are included to 
 provide the full locker details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To remove a locker from a student, select the blank locker value at 
 the top of the drop down list of lockers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Lock (serial #  - combination - lock 
 type)</span>: In some situations, the lock information will automatically 
 appear when the locker is selected:<br/>
</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>If the selected locker has a built-in lock, the lock information 
	 will automatically appear and no additional information is required. 
	  For these lockers, lock information may not be edited from the 
	 student’s record.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>If the student is assigned a locker that has a capacity of more 
	 than 1 student, lock information is shared with all the students assigned 
	 to the locker. Therefore, when the student’s locker is assigned, and 
	 the shared locker already has another student, that other student’s 
	 lock information will automatically appear.  Changing the lock 
	 information for one student will change the information for the other 
	 student(s) automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student is provided a lock from the school, use the option <span style="color: #007fff;">Existing lock,</span> and then start typing 
 the serial number of the lock to see matching locks from the previously 
 set up list of available school-owned locks. In addition to the serial 
 number, the combination and lock type are included to provide the full 
 lock details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To remove a lock from a student, enter N/A for the lock serial number.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the lock is not found in the list, or if the student is using their 
 own personal lock, use the option <span style="color: #007fff;">New lock</span>, 
 and then enter the lock information as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-locker5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:804px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Serial number</span>:  Enter the 
 serial number of the lock, if provided by the manufacturer. </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Combination</span>:  Enter the combination 
 of the lock in the format ##.##.##.</p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Lock type</span>:  Select the type 
 of lock (e.g. type or manufacturer or style) of the lock from the list 
 defined by the school.</p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Lock owner</span>:  Select the lock 
 owner from the list.  Two options exist: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>School supplied lock:  The lock is owned by school and is 
	 loaned to the student. When a school owned lock is no longer used 
	 by the student, the physical lock is returned to the office.  The 
	 lock information remains in the school’s table of locks so that the 
	 lock may be used again by another student. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Student’s personal lock: The lock is owned by the student.  When 
	 a student-owned lock is no longer used by the student, it is removed 
	 from the school’s table of locks. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the student’s locker and lock information is correctly entered, 
 select the SAVE button in the bottom right corner.</p>
