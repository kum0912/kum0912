  <h1>Import OENs</h1>
  <hr align="center" style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

  <p>If the publicly funded school (or board) has submitted an OEN request file to the Ministry, once the request file has been processed by the Ministry, down load the ‘results’ file from the Ministry’s OEN website (following directions provided by your board).  After the results file is downloaded from the Ministry, use the Import OENs option to process this file, which will import the newly assigned OENs into the students’ records, by following these steps:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>1. After the OEN request file has been submitted to the Ministry’s OEN website, and it is processed, download the results file from the OEN website.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>2. School users choose Ontario reporting, Ontario Education Numbers (OEN) from the main menu (the board can’t import OENs).</p>
  <p><br />
    <br />
    <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-import-oen-card.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:190px;" />
  </p>
  <p><br />
    <br />
    Select the GO button on the Import OENs card to access the Import OENs page:
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-import-oen-main.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:590px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>3. Select the folder icon to the left of the “Location of OEN file” to access file manager. It will open the File manager at the (school name) &gt; Provincial &gt; OEN &gt; Import folder as shown below. Use the Add icon in the app bar to add the file downloaded in step 1.  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-import-oen-file-manager.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:675px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>4. Select the file to be processed. Filenames shown below are examples only, however they must have the xml extension to appear.   </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/on-import-oen-import-file.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:645px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>5. Select the IMPORT RESULTS FILE button in the bottom bar, as shown above.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>6. A task will be submitted to process the file, which will automatically import the new OENs into the students’ records, or provide a report indicating any errors/reasons why the OEN could not be assigned. You may leave the application because an automatic notification will appear when the file is created. The notification will link you to any reports generated from this process. Reports are also available in <a href="../setup/setup-file-manager.htm">File manage</a>r in the Provincial &gt; OEN &gt; Results folder.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>7. Analyze the results in the report (as discussed in step 6). The report will indicate the students who have had OENs assigned to their student record in the OEN number field.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The report may also indicate students whose OENs were not assigned. These are students whose information matches another record in the Ministry&#39;s database who is potentially the same student. For these students, use the Ministry&#39;s OEN system to identify whether this student is the same student or is someone unique. Through this process the student&#39;s OEN issue is resolved.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Occasionally, the report may also indicate students who are not enrolled in this school. These are students that have had either their surnames or birth dates changed since the request was made for OENs. For these students, enter the OEN manually in the student’s record (under the <a href="../students/enrolment-students.htm">Enrolment &gt; Student enrolment</a> option).</p>
