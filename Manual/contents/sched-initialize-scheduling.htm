<h1><a name="Initialize_next_year" id="Initialize_next_year"></a>Initialize 
 next year</h1>
 <p>The student and school class information 
 for the next school year is distinct from the corresponding information 
 for this school year.  Each year, when you are ready to start scheduling, 
 you must first run the initialize next year process.  This process 
 performs the following functions based on the options selected as part 
 of this process:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Sets the school year status to This Year Only for students attending 
	 the school this year in the school’s highest grade.  Each student’s 
	 exit date (retirement/transfer date), exit description, and destination 
	 school (if applicable) is set to the defaults set by the school.  Students 
	 in the highest grade in the school are assumed to be leaving the school 
	 at the end of this year, and those who aren’t leaving can be adjusted 
	 manually after the process is completed.   </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Advances each student’s grade next year based on the progression 
	 of grades set by the school.  This year’s grade is not changed.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Each student’s homeroom next year can be removed (set to not assigned) 
	 or it may be set to the same homeroom as this year (if the list of 
	 homerooms is copied from this year to next year).  Similarly, 
	 each student’s advisor group can be removed or set the same as this 
	 year.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Each student’s course selections can be erased (to remove last 
	 year’s course selections) or retained (if applicable, as in a situation 
	 where initialize is run again).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To access Initialize next year choose Scheduling next year &gt; Prepare 
 for next year. Select the GO button  on the Initialize next year 
 card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-initialize-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:253px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You&#39;ll see the Initialize next year screen:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-initialize-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:710px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Set the options as required for your school (explained below), and then 
 select the INITIALIZE button.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the initialize process is completed, you&#39;ll see the most recent 
 Initialize details in the bottom bar.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you attempt to initialize again, you will see this warning  message. 
 Type WIPE NEXT YEAR to enable the INITIALIZE button, otherwise select 
 CANCEL.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-initialize-message.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:642px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue" style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Graduating_students" id="Graduating_students"></a>Graduating 
 students</p>
<p>The Graduating students card will default the highest grade in your 
 school, the exit date (based on your school’s calendar), and an exit description 
 for your school type (elementary vs secondary) and province.  Any 
 of these fields may be changed, and if all students in the highest grade 
 are going to the same school, the destination school may be selected. 
 Students in the highest grade (or higher) will have their edsembli status 
 changed to ‘this year only’ and their exit date and reason will be set 
 to the values set here.  Here is an example of the card:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-initialize-grad-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:591px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Students who are in the highest grade who are already ‘This year only’ 
 or ‘Withdrawn’ will be excluded so that they will retain entered exit 
 dates and descriptions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue" style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Progression_of_grades" id="Progression_of_grades"></a>Progression 
 of grades</p>
<p>The Progression of grades card will be collapsed by default.  Expand 
 the card to see the grade progression.  The students in the grade 
 in the left column (this year grade) will be advanced to the grade in 
 the right column (next year grade).  The progression of grades is 
 based on the sort order in the table of grades.  Here is an example 
 of the card:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-initialize-progression-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:591px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue" style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Next_year_homerooms" id="Next_year_homerooms"></a>Next 
 year homerooms</p>
<p>Some schools retain similar homerooms from year to year, and some prefer 
 to have the list of homerooms completely empty.  If you prefer to 
 have an empty homeroom list, select the last option “Delete next year 
 homerooms &amp; set students’ next year homerooms to not assigned”.  More 
 commonly, the homerooms from this year are copied to next year (by selecting 
 the first option “Copy this year homerooms to next year”).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the homerooms are copied (e.g. the table containing the homerooms 
 is copied), the students’ homerooms may be either:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>set to the same homeroom as the current homeroom using the option 
	 “Copy students’ this year homerooms to next year homerooms”, or  </li>
	<li>cleared out (set to not assigned) using the option “Set students’ 
	 next year homerooms to not assigned”. This is the recommended option 
	 for elementary school who schedule using the assigned classes feature 
	 in homerooms.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example of the card:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-initialize-nyhomeroom-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:591px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next year homerooms assigned to students during the initial process 
 are typically reassigned later in the scheduling process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue" style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Next_year_advisor_groups" id="Next_year_advisor_groups"></a>Next 
 year advisor groups</p>
<p>School s that don&#39;t use advisor groups may ignore this setting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some schools retain similar advisor groups from year to year, and some 
 prefer to have the list of advisor groups completely empty.  If you 
 prefer to have an empty advisor group list, select the last option “Delete 
 next year advisor groups &amp; set students’ next year advisor groups 
 to not assigned”.  More commonly, the advisor groups from this year 
 are copied to next year (by selecting the first option “Copy this year 
 advisor groups to next year”).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the advisor groups are copied (e.g. the table containing the advisor 
 groups is copied), the students’ advisor groups may be either:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>set to the same advisor group as the current advisor group using the 
 option “Copy students’ this year advisor groups to next year advisor groups”, 
 or  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>cleared out (set to not assigned) using the option “Set students’ next 
 year advisor groups to not assigned”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example of the card:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-initialize-nyadvisor-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:723px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next year advisor groups assigned to students during the initial 
 process may be reassigned later in the scheduling process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue" style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Course_selections" id="Course_selections"></a>Course 
 selections</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">This card applies to secondary schools only.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The initialize next year process is recommended to be run prior to the 
 entry of the course selections for students.  For that reason, it 
 will  default ‘erase all course selections for all students’ to ensure 
 that all course selections from the previous school year are removed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-initialize-coursesel-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:723px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two other options exist to handle unique situations that may apply for 
 some schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>If the school has course selections already recorded for new students 
	 who are not already in the school (school year status is next year 
	 only), but all other students still have their previous year’s courses, 
	 use the option “Retain course selections for next year only students 
	 &amp; erase courses for all others”.</li>
	<li>If the school needs to initialize again and all the students already 
	 have their course selections recorded, use the option “Retain all 
	 course selections as entered”.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue" style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Course_expiry_effective_dates" id="Course_expiry_effective_dates"></a>Course 
 expiry/effective dates</p>
<p>Sometimes courses are no longer applicable for the forthcoming school 
 year, and these courses have been expired by the board/division/district 
 in the codes table. Similarly, the codes table may contain new codes that 
 should be added to your school&#39;s list of courses.  These options 
 allow the school&#39;s list of course to contain only the relevant courses 
 based on the effective and expiry dates of the codes. Expiry date must 
 be specified to match the dates set in the codes (e.g. August 30, 2019 
 would mean that any codes expired on August 30 or earlier would not be 
 copied into the school&#39;s next year&#39;s courses table).</p>
