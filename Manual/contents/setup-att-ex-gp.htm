  <p>Overview</p>
  <p>In preparation for recording student attendance, the parameters are set up for the school to tailor the attendance applications to match the needs of the school. The setup of the attendance codes is generally done during the initial setup of a new school, and rarely needs to be revisited.</p>
  <p>The setup area for the attendance parameters is used to define the following:</p>
  <p>• The attendance methods required by the school, in other words, how is the attendance taken at the school. For example, is attendance recorded for the morning/afternoon only, or by period based on the classes in the student’s timetable, or does the school need both methods depending upon the student? If both methods are required, the default method to be assigned to new students can be defined (e.g. adding a new student in grade 1 can default morning/afternoon method, and adding a new student in grade 10 can default the ‘by period’ method.</p>
  <p>• If attendance is recorded by period, these additional parameters are defined:</p>
  <p>- whether distinct homeroom attendance is recorded</p>
  <p>- what period is the first period of the afternoon</p>
  <p>- if a class is taught in more than 1 period per day (i.e. double period classes), do you want to record attendance once for the day or for each period (e.g. it would be entered twice for a double period class).  If the attendance is entered once for the day, do you want attendance totals to count the number of periods or days the student missed the class.</p>
  <p>Access to the setup of the attendance parameters is available from 2 locations:</p>
  <p>Select the Menu icon in the left corner, then select either Attendance, then Setup or select Setup, then Attendance.</p>
  <p>  </p>
  <p>This will take you to the attendance setup section where you will find the Parameters card.</p>
  <p>  </p>
  <p>Select the GO button on the card to access the setup of school’s attendance parameters.</p>
  <p>Parameters</p>
  <p>Here is an example of the attendance parameters setup.</p>
  <p>   </p>
  <p>The following fields may appear on the attendance parameters form:</p>
  <p>Attendance method(s) required by school:  Select 1 option from the 3 possible options:</p>
  <p>Morning/afternoon:  With this method, attendance is entered twice a day, corresponding to the morning and the afternoon attendance.  This is also sometimes referred to as half day attendance.  If this option is selected, no other attendance parameters are applicable.</p>
  <p>By period:  With this method, attendance is entered for each class in the student’s timetable.</p>
  <p>Both:  With this option, some students will have attendance entered for the morning/afternoon, and some will have it entered for each class.</p>
  <p>Default attendance method:  This card only appears if the school requires both morning/afternoon and by period attendance. This area allows you to select the default attendance method to be given to a newly added student.  Since typically the attendance method is determined by the student’s grade, it will list all the grades in the school along with the default method.  Select any grade (click the row) to change the attendance method.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>By period settings:  This area only appears if the ‘Attendance method(s) required by school’ field is set to either by period or both.  The following fields must be set:</p>
  <p>Is homeroom attendance to be taken and recorded as its own entry:  Check the box if the students go to a homeroom and attendance is taken and recorded for that homeroom.  A distinct homeroom attendance entry will be recorded.  Typically, if homeroom is at the start of a period, and the teacher only takes attendance once, this field is set to No (unchecked) so that the attendance taken by the teacher is recorded for the class only and references to homeroom attendance are hidden in the application.</p>
  <p>First afternoon period:  Select the period that represents the start of the afternoon.  For example, if period 1 and 2 are in the morning, and period 3 is in the afternoon, enter 3.  This setting is used when converting period attendance into am/pm attendance.</p>
  <p>How is attendance taken for classes taught in more than 1 period:  Select 1 of the following 2 options:</p>
  <p>Enter once per day:  This is the option that is typically selected because multiple period classes are typically in sequential periods, and the teacher only needs to enter attendance once.  If this option is selected, an additional field called Attendance totals will appear to determine if attendance for these classes is to be counted once for the day, or to be counted by period.  For example, if student is absent for a double period class, the teacher records Absent once.  When reports count the number of times the student was absent for that class, do you want this to count as 1 absence (select Count by day), or 2 absences (select Count by period).</p>
  <p>Enter once per period:  This option means that the teacher is expected to record attendance for each period where that class is scheduled.  This option would be recommended if a school schedules classes in non-sequential period (e.g. the class is scheduled in period 1 and period 4 on the same day).</p>
  <p>Attendance parameters business rules (internal documentation only)</p>
  <p>Note:  anything labelled as FYI is for your information only so that you can understand how this field impacts other areas of the application.</p>
  <p>1. Option appears for schools only.  Central office does not have attendance parameters.  Later, we can provide ability for central office to select a school to see what that school has in their parameters.</p>
  <p>Attendance method(s) required by school:</p>
  <p>2. Attendance method(s) required by school – select 1 option from 3 possible options (Morning/afternoon, By period, Both).</p>
  <p>3. If Morning/afternoon option is selected, no other attendance parameters should appear.</p>
  <p>4. If Both is selected, show the Default attendance method card.  Populate it with all grades in the school.  Each grade must have a method selected (either morning/after or by period).</p>
  <p>5. If By period or Both is selected, show the By period settings area.</p>
  <p>fyi – if this field is set to Both, each student will have an attendance method field that can be edited.  The other methods will still expose the field in the student’s record but it cannot be edited.</p>
  <p>By period settings:</p>
  <p>6. If ‘Is homeroom attendance to be taken and recorded as its own entry’ = YES (box is checked), then in the database it will store the homeroom period as 1 (legacy field not needed in new web system).  If unchecked, store as 0.</p>
  <p>7. First afternoon period – drop down shows values from 1 to # of periods in the school’s setup for this year.</p>
  <p>8. ‘How is attendance taken for classes taught in more than 1 period’ has 2 options:  Enter once per day or Enter once per period.  Only if this is set to once per day, show the field ‘ Attendance totals’. If set to once per period, hide the field ‘Attendance totals’.  </p>
  <p>9. Attendance totals field has 2 options:  Count by day and Count by period.</p>
  <p>Fyi - Check box ‘ Is homeroom attendance to be taken and recorded as its own entry’.  This will enable the enter attendance “homeroom” card for schools that only have “by period” attendance method.  The other methods get the homeroom attendance entry regardless of this option.</p>
  <p>Fyi – ‘first afternoon period’ is used to determine how to convert period attendance to am/pm attendance which is in some attendance reports.  E.g. if a school has 4 periods, and period 3 is entered here, if a student has AAPP recorded for the 4 periods attendance, it will be converted to A/P (actually it appears as A/ but you can read up about that in the important concepts section of the attendance manual).</p>
  <p>Fyi – ‘How is attendance taken for classes taught in more than 1 period’ – if set to once per period, the entry of class attendance (in Attendance &gt; Enter attendance) will list the class multiple times (e.g. if displaying all periods, the class will appear for each period), and each period will have its own flag as to whether or not the attendance is taken.  If it set to once per day, if displaying all periods, the class will be listed once (e.g. showing as Period 1 &amp; 2), but it will also display if you select just period 1 or just period 2.  Once the attendance is taken in the first period, it will be flagged as taken if it were to be accessed in period 2.  The attendance entered for period 1 is copied into the attendance in period 2 (and vice versa).</p>
