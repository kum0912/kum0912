  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a> Overview</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">The Graduation requirements option in a student’s record is an area where you can indicate what diploma a student is working towards (e.g. their graduation requirements), and schools can then monitor the student’s completed courses in relation to the course categories they need to fulfill the requirements. Once all the requirements are fulfilled, the student’s earned diploma may be recorded. Only the school that is the edsembli record owner can edit the student’s graduation requirements and earned diploma information.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img height="275" src="assets/images/gradreq.jpg" width="267" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">The Graduation requirements option is available for current, past and future students. This option does not exist in elementary schools.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Each course that a student has completed is recorded in the Completed courses area of the student’s record. Courses can be completed from any school, and all of these courses will be considered as potentially fulfilling the student’s graduation requirements.  Each course has a category that is used to determine whether the credits earned for the course will count towards the required credits for a category (e.g. requirements indicate student needs 4 English credits).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">The board/division/district will setup the graduation requirements, including the name of the requirement, the category names and the number of required credits.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">The student’s graduation requirements can be shown in a summary format, showing just totals for each category (e.g. earned, required, and remaining credits in English). It can also include projected totals, assuming the student will successfully complete all courses in their current timetable.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">The student’s graduation requirements can also be shown in detailed format, listing the completed courses that are being counted in each category.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">The Graduation requirements menu option is located in the Achievement sub-menu</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts1.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 299px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Once selected, Graduation requirements card and Diploma card, become available.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <h2><a name="Graduation_requirements" id="Graduation_requirements"></a> Graduation requirements</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">If a student does not yet have their requirements defined, use the Add graduation requirements icon to indicate which requirement applies to this student by selecting from the provided list. If the student&#39;s requirement needs changing, use the Edit graduation requirements icon. Ontario schools only will have an &#39;Add SHSM&#39; icon shown to the right of the add/edit graduation requirements icon. See <a href="#Ontario_graduation_requirements">Ontario graduation requirements &amp; SHSM</a> for more info.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts2.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Upon saving the requirements, the Graduation requirements card will display information about the credits the student has earned towards the required credits. This example shows Summary and Earned credits.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts3.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:908px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">There are 2 settings in the tool bar that will impact the display on this card:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary or Detailed</span>: Summary will show just the credit totals (earned, required, remaining) for each category. Detailed will show the courses whose credits are counting in each category.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Earned or Projected</span>: Earned will only consider courses that are in the student’s completed courses area. Projected will consider the student’s completed courses and the courses in the timetable that are not yet completed, making the assumption that the student will successfully complete those courses.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Here is an example using the Summary and Projected settings:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts5.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 737px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">This example shows Detailed and Earned settings.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts6.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 938px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Here is an example using Detailed and Projected settings:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts7.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 956px;" /></p>
  <h3>Print detailed credit requirements breakdown</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">On Detailed and Summary screens you can select Print from the More icon.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/class-info-time47.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 140px;" /></p>
  <p>This will generate the credit breakdown summary or detail report for the student.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts7-4.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 517px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px; font-style: italic;">Note: In this report, a course may be repeated if it belongs to a category group but the student has other courses that fulfill that group, so it will show the course in both the category (but it will show 0 of its credits counting in that category) and it will show in the Other credits area (where it will be counted).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <h2><a name="Diploma" id="Diploma"></a> Diploma</h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Once a student has fulfilled all graduating requirements you can record the student’s diploma. There are no automatic processes that will automatically populate diploma information, however there are reports that may be generated to determine potential graduates. This is intentional in design.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">A student may have up to two 2 diplomas recorded, and the diploma may be recorded even if the graduation requirement card indicates that the student has no requirements specified or the student appears to have not met all their requirements.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts8.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 738px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Use the Edit icon in the tool bar to edit the diploma information.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts9.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:823px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">The following 3 fields are recorded for each diploma:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">First diploma</span>: This is the name of the diploma granted to the student. The board/division/district will define the list of diplomas available for selection.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date</span>: This is the date the diploma was granted.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Issuing School</span>: This is the school that issued the diploma. It will default this school’s name when entering a new diploma. The  board/division/district defines the list of schools.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
  <h2><a id="Ontario_graduation_requirements"></a> Ontario graduation requirements &amp; SHSM</h2>
  <p>Ontario students have additional graduation requirements as explained here.  As explained above, the student will be given a graduation requirement as defined by the board to track the student&#39;s credit requirements. These are the additional requirements for Ontario schools only:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li><span><a href="achievement-grad-reqmts.htm" style="color: #000000; 
				 font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; ">Other requirements</a>: Be</span><span>low the student&#39;s credit requirements, a card titled &quot;Other requirements&quot; will appear with information about the student&#39;s:</span><br />

      <span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Ontario scholar</span>: Yes/No field to indicate whether the student is an Ontario Scholar (as per Ministry definition of an Ontario scholar).<br />
      <span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Scholarship date</span>: The date the student earned the Ontario scholar designation..
    </li>
    <li style="text-decoration: none; "><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="#SHSM_requirements__Ontario_only_" style="font-weight: bold; 
	 color: #000000; text-decoration: none; ">SHSM requirements</a>:</span><span> Students in grade 11 and 12 may also want to complete additional requirements to earn the Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) red seal on their diploma.  This has many requirements, as explained below. </span></li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <h3><a id="SHSM_requirements__Ontario_only_"></a> SHSM requirements (Ontario only)</h3>
  <p>Students may optionally enroll in a Specialist High Skills Major program (SHSM) for grades 11 and 12 and upon successful completion of the SHSM requirements, they can get a red seal on their regular diploma. Students cannot be granted the regular diploma and then get issued the red seal version, they must not be granted a diploma until the SHSM requirements are completed. </p>
  <p>Each student enrolled in a  SHSM program has a pathway (apprenticeship, college, workplace, or university), required credits, required certifications/training and a number of other requirements that must be completed. Once all this is completed, a completion date is recorded for the SHSM. The board is responsible for the set up of the SHSM requirements (credits, other requirements and certificates/training) using Setup &gt; Graduation requirements &gt; SHSM.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">If a student does not yet have their SHSM requirements defined, use the Add SHSM icon to indicate which requirement applies to this student by selecting the SHSM program and pathway from the provided lists.  The selected program will appear in a tab so that you may navigate between the regular diploma requirements (OSS ENGLISH -2009 in example below) and the student&#39;s SHSM program (NON-PROFIT (2017) in example below). If the student&#39;s SHSM program needs changing, use the Edit SHSM requirements icon that appears when the tab navigation is set to the SHSM requirement.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts-shsm1.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Upon saving the SHSM requirements, the Graduation requirements &amp; SHSM card will display information about the credits the student has earned towards the required SHSM credits. This example shows Summary and Earned credits but these may be changed to Detailed and Projected (as explained earlier).</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts-shsm2.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 696px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>After the credit requirements for the SHSM program, a card titled SHSM-Other requirements will appear. These other requirements need to be fulfilled in addition to the credit requirements.  As these requirements are completed, use the Edit icon to change the Yes/No fields to Yes. Once all SHSM requirements are completed here, and the student&#39;s credit and certifications/training requirements are fulfilled, use the Edit icon to set the SHSM completion date.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts-shsm3.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 805px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>After the other requirements, the SHSM - Certificates &amp; training card will appear. It will show the student&#39;s completed certificates and training that are related to the student&#39;s SHSM program. Select an existing certificate/training (e.g. row click) to access the Edit option.  Use the Add icon in the tool bar to add a new certificate/training.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts-shsm4.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 840px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Use the SHSM certificates/training info icon to see the certificates and training values that are defined as requirements for the student&#39;s SHSM program and pathway.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-grad-reqmts-shsm5.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 969px;" /></p>
  <p>When a student has SHSM requirements as described above, an icon appears in the student&#39;s profile. Hovering over the icon will show the student&#39;s SHSM program and pathway, and selecting the icon will take you directly to the Achievement &gt; Graduation requirements &amp; SHSM option in the student&#39;s record.</p>
