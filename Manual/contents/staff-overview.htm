<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>Most schools and board/divisions have other applications that track 
 detailed staff and payroll information. Staff records require minimal 
 information for staff members that are involved in the students’ education, 
 as well as those staff members that require access to edsembli CONNECT. 
 Additional staff may be optionally added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At a minimum, each staff record requires the person’s name. Boards/divisions/districts 
 should provide guidance on what information must be recorded for each 
 staff record. For example, some provinces collect information on a teacher’s 
 classes, requiring the entry of the provincial teacher number. The staff 
 member’s board/division email address is also often required if security 
 access to the SIS is provided through an authenticated service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each staff member is considered a single person with a single staff 
 record, however that person may be a staff member at multiple schools. Staff 
 also exist at the board/division/district (central office). When a new 
 staff member is added, if the staff member matches another staff member 
 already in the board/division/district, they will be considered the same 
 staff member.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The staff record menu options are accessed by selecting the Menu icon 
 in the left corner, then selecting the Staff records to see the 2 submenu 
 options: Search staff and Add staff as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:508px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When a staff member is active in more than 1 school, the person specific 
 data may be edited by either school. The following staff information is 
 considered person-specific:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Name and numbers</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Demographics</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Contact info</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All other information is considered school specific, meaning that the 
 information is unique for each school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each school is responsible for assigning staff members (teachers) to 
 homerooms, advisor groups, and classes, and this information is available 
 for viewing from the staff record; however, it cannot be edited here. 
 Class information defined by the school is used to create the teacher’s 
 timetable.</p>
<h2><a name="Search_staff" id="Search_staff"></a>Search staff</h2>
<p>To access a staff member’s record, select the Menu icon in the left 
 corner, then select Staff records then Search staff from the menu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the resulting screen (shown below), enter as much or as little 
 of the staff member’s name as you want then select the search button or 
 Enter key. For example, enter ‘H’ for a list of staff whose surnames start 
 with H, or enter ‘Holcomb’ for a list of staff whose surnames start with 
 Holcomb. Your search may show multiple staff matching the search name, 
 so make sure you select the right one. Hint: enter % for a list of all 
 staff.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:697px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:817px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every staff member in edsembli CONNECT has a record like this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:982px;" border="0"/></p>
<h2><a name="Menu" id="Menu"></a>Menu</h2>
<p>The staff record represents a single access point for the information 
 recorded for the staff member. The information is broken down into areas 
 based on the type of information recorded for the person. Using the menu 
 on the left, the content will change to reflect the menu option selected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The staff records menu can be hidden or shown by selecting the icon 
 in the top right corner of the staff member’s profile. The same icon is 
 now used for show vs hide, however the tooltip will correctly indicate 
 whether selecting the icon will hide the menu, or show the menu. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: this icon will appear in the toolbar 
 on smaller devices.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:34px;" border="0"/> 
  Use this icon to show or hide the staff record menu and profile 
 area.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Staff records has an advanced search feature that lets you search for 
 a specific area in the record (e.g. name). Enter criteria beside the Search 
 icon and results will automatically display.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview6.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:348px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For further information on menus, see <a href="../startup/start-common-features.htm#Menus">Menus 
 in Common Features</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="App_bar" id="App_bar"></a>App bar</h2>
<p>The App bar for Staff records appears across the top of the staff member’s 
 record. Use the Menu icon in the top left corner to navigate to other 
 areas of the SIS (e.g. leave the staff records area).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are some convenient icons in the top right corner:</p>
<p> </p>
<table width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td style="vertical-align: top;"><img alt="" src="assets/images/staff-mag-glass.png" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:25px"/></td>
		<td>The Select staff icon calls up the Select staff screen.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> </td>
		<td> </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align: top;"><img alt="" src="assets/images/staff-lessthan.png" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:27px"/><img alt="" src="assets/images/staff-greaterthan.png" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:27px"/></td>
		<td>The Previous and Next icons move (step) to the next or previous 
		 staff in the list of resulting staff (e.g. the staff matching 
		 the search criteria used to find this person).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> </td>
		<td> </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align: top;"><img alt="" src="assets/images/staff-launch.png" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:28px"/> </td>
		<td>The New window icon lets you keep your existing browser window 
		 (tab) open while opening a new browser tab with 3 possible options. The 
		 options will appear when the icon is selected as shown here: 
		<br/>   
		<br/><img src="assets/images/staff-open-new.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:187px;" border="0"/> 
		<br/>   
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New staff</span>:  takes 
		 you to the select staff interface where a new staff may be selected</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">D</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">ashboard</span>: 
		  takes you to the initial dashboard page</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Duplicate student</span>:  creates 
		 another browser session with the same staff information (creates 
		 a duplicate of the page you were looking at).</p>
		<p> </p>
		This is handy because you can have multiple staff records open 
		 at the same time. 
		<br/>   
		<br/><span style="font-style: italic;">Hint: browser 
		 tabs can be maximized or restored down to smaller sizes so that 
		 they can be repositioned side by side.</span></td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><br style="margin-left: 40px;"/>
</p>
<h2><a name="Profile" id="Profile"></a>Profile</h2>
<p>The staff Profile area contains the staff’s picture, and other pertinent 
 information for easy reference. Pictures are usually imported annually, 
 but if a staff member’s picture is not available or needs updating, click 
 the staff picture area to select an image from your source.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Hint: to see the staff photo in full saved 
 size right click a staff’s picture, then choose Open image in a new tab. 
 This works only in Chrome browser.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The profile area shows the staff member’s usual names and legal names. 
 Usual names appear first and are formatted as Usual Name and Surname. 
 Legal names are displayed second, in a smaller font, and are formatted 
 as legal surname, given name + middle name(s) + , suffix (if applicable).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:351px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Status is a quick way to organize staff based on when they are/have 
 or will be working at this school. Every staff member is assigned a status 
 reflective of the staff member’s employment at the school being accessed. 
 The following statuses are available:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">This year 
 and next year:</span> staff member is actively working at the school this 
 year and is scheduled to work at the school next year.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">This year 
 only:</span> staff member is actively working at the school this year 
 but is not expected to be working at this school next year.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Next year 
 only:</span> staff member is working at this school next year (e.g. new 
 to the school next year). Next year only staff members show their next 
 year homeroom and advisor group in the profile area (if they are a homeroom 
 or advisor group teacher).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inactive:</span> 
 Staff was working at this school at some point this school year but has 
 since left this school.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Past:</span> 
 Staff worked at the school in previous years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following additional information will appear in the profile area, 
 if data exists for the staff member:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Employee no.</span>: Local employee 
 number for board/division identification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Provincial teaching number</span>: 
 (field name changes depending on your province e.g. Teacher certificate 
 # for Alberta). Field is only applicable if the staff member is an educator 
 (teacher).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Homeroom</span>: If applicable, the 
 staff member’s current homeroom designation and room number.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Advisor group</span>: If applicable, 
 the staff member’s current advisor group name and room number. Advisor 
 groups are similar to homerooms where a room and teacher(s) is/are assigned 
 to the advisor group. The name of the group can be anything the school 
 wants. Some schools use advisor groups to indicate the guidance counsellor 
 assigned to the student. Some schools have students meet regularly in 
 groups where the students meet with an advisory teacher to discuss general 
 school related topics.</p>
<h2><a name="Content" id="Content"></a>Content</h2>
<p>Now that you understand the profile and app bar, the main content area 
 of the staff record is where the staff member’s data will appear as you 
 navigate through different menu options.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following menu options are available for staff records:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview7-1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:325px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Refer to the specific sections of the manual for details on each menu 
 option. Please keep in mind that your security rights will determine whether 
 or not you have view or edit access to specific areas of the staff member’s 
 record.</p>

 record is opened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:329px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The summary page may contain up to 3 cards:</p>

<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview9.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:327px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Name card contains the staff member’s preferred (usual) names as 
 well as the exact legal names as provided on an official source document. 
 For most staff, the surname field is the same as their legal surname. 
  </p>

<p>The Demographics menu option is located in the Personal submenu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/staff-overview11.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:327px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Class_info" id="Class_info"></a>Class info</h2>
<h3><a name="Classes" id="Classes"></a>Classes</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview13.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:347px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Class info menu option will only appear if the staff member is assigned 
 to at least one class, homeroom, or advisor group in this school, considering 
 class info for this school year or next school year. Therefore, the 
 class info area will not appear for most non-teaching staff, unless they 
 are assigned to an advisor group.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Homeroom and advisor group information is displayed in the Classes submenu. 
 The Timetable submenu is where the teacher’s class schedule information 
 is displayed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Edits to the teacher’s class information are not possible from the staff 
 member’s record. The staff record is presenting the information set up 
 by the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><a name="Current_location" id="Current_location"></a>Current 
 location</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the staff member’s timetable contains 
 at least one class in a period today, the Current location card is available 
 to indicate where the teacher may be located right now by showing the 
 class, room and teacher information for the current period (based on the 
 current time compared to the school’s period times). If the teacher is 
 not assigned a class in the current period, the words “Teacher is not 
 in any class at this time” will appear. Use the period tab strip to change 
 to a different period.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the staff member is teaching a class at 
 another school, the background will be shaded.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><a name="Homeroom_advisor_group_info" id="Homeroom_advisor_group_info"></a>Homeroom/advisor 
 group info</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the staff member is assigned to a homeroom 
 or an advisor group for the current year, this card will appear. Homeroom 
 information includes the homeroom designation and room number, along with 
 the name(s) of the staff member(s) assigned to the homeroom. Similarly, 
 advisor group information includes the group name and room number, along 
 with the name(s) of the staff member(s) assigned to the advisor group.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the teacher is assigned to a homeroom 
 or advisor group in another school in the board/division, you&#39;ll see a 
 card titled Homeroom/advisor group info – Other schools.</p>
<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;"><a name="Course_workload_-_current" id="Course_workload_-_current"></a>Course 
 workload - current</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The teacher&#39;s current school year classes 
 will appear in either the course workload - current, or current workload 
 - completed cards. If you need additional information please see <a href="../students/class-info-classes.htm#Course_workload">Course 
 workload</a> in Student records.</p>
<h3><a name="Timetable" id="Timetable"></a>Timetable</h3>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview14.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:345px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Timetable option presents the teacher’s classes organized by periods, 
 days, terms and semesters. Each school’s setup defines the number of semesters, 
 terms in a semester, days in cycle, and periods per day. Each class offered 
 by the school is assigned to the appropriate semester(s), term(s), day(s) 
 and period(s) that correspond to where that class is taught. This information 
 is used to determine where the class appears in the teacher’s timetable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The teacher’s timetable may be viewed in 3 basic formats by selecting 
 either Today, Summary - grid, or Summary - list from the drop down list 
 as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/staff-overview17.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:445px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Examples of the teacher timetable views are shown below. They follow 
 the same concepts as student timetables, except that the timetable may 
 not be edited from the staff record. For detailed explanation of 
 timetables, please see the <a href="../students/class-info-timetable.htm">Timetable 
 section for students</a>.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">School year status</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p>The school year status is a quick way to organize staff based on when 
 they are/have been/will be working at this school. Every staff is assigned 
 a status reflective of the staff member’s employment at the school being 
 accessed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">This year 
 and next year:</span> staff member is actively working at the school this 
 year and is scheduled to work at the school next year.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">This year 
 only:</span> staff member is actively working at the school this year 
 but is not expected to be working at this school next year.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Next year 
 only:</span> staff member is working at this school next year (e.g. new 
 to the school next year). Next year only staff members show their next 
 year homeroom and advisor group in the profile area (if they are a homeroom 
 or advisor group teacher).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Withdrawn 
 or Inactive:</span> Staff member was working at this school at some point 
 this school year but has since left this school.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Past:</span> 
 Staff member worked at the school in previous years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="assets/images/staff-overview25.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:483px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Role</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Role area shows the role of the staff member in the school. Roles 
 are defined centrally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Is Teacher</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the staff member is to be assigned to any class or homeroom, the 
 Is teacher switch should be enabled (set to yes).  If it is set to 
 no, the staff member will not be available for assignment (their name 
 will not appear in the class and homeroom teacher drop down lists).</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: it may be necessary to remove the 
 teacher from classes, homerooms, or advisor groups before changing their 
 School year status or setting the Teacher switch to no. If a teacher is 
 leaving the school part way through the school year, first assign a new 
 teacher to the classes, homerooms, and advisor groups, and then edit the 
 employment information in the staff record.</p>
