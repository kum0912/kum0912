  <h1>Student records &gt; Achievement &gt; Completed courses (Alberta)</h1>
  <hr align="center" style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" />
  <p><a name="Alberta" id="Alberta"></a> <strong style="font-size: 18pt">Alberta</strong></p>
  <p>Alberta Education is responsible for generating a student’s official transcript based on detailed course enrolment, mark and exam registration (when applicable) information that is provided by the schools to PASI. edsembli’s completed course area provides both a record of the student’s completed courses that may include courses that are not part of the official transcript, or may represent course and exam activities as they pertained to the school year and is where schools can add completed courses to be sent to PASI.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Alberta Education has defined a list of official course codes for courses in grade 10 to 12 that may be used on official transcripts. The official course codes are recorded in the PASI code field. PASI collects information only for these codes, which will be referred to as provincially defined codes. If a code is provincially defined, and the division has Course Mark Integration enabled, many fields are not editable, (such as course title and grade level).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>With Course Mark Integration, provincially defined courses from a student’s timetable, including newly added classes after the start of the school year as well as dropped classes are sent in real-time to PASI. In edsembli SIS, the courses in the student’s timetable are automatically moved into the completed courses area when the school runs a process after final marks are entered (<a href="../achievement/add-completed-courses.htm">Achievement &gt; Completed courses &gt; Add completed courses</a>). This process will also submit the student’s school mark to PASI.</p>
  <p><img height="250" src="assets/images/addcomcourses.jpg" width="246" /></p>
  <p>Adding completed courses in Alberta is typically reserved for the addition of a grade 10 to 12 course that was taken outside of Alberta’s learning systems and the school is awarding an evaluated mark. These evaluated courses are also reported to PASI, and they will be considered an evaluated mark based on the evaluation method field.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>With Course Mark Integration with PASI, provincially defined courses cannot be modified with respect to the course details that were reported based on the student’s enrolment in a class. The mark can be edited for the current school year only, and editions are reported to PASI.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>An example of a completed courses card for an Alberta school:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-comp-courses1-1.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 889px;" /></p>
  <p>Due to the number of fields recorded for each completed course, it may be necessary to scroll to the right to see more fields, or select one row to access the Details option to see all the fields for that one completed course.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The completed courses area also contains class attendance information that is automatically transferred based on the daily attendance taken by the school. This information is not collected by PASI and therefore can be edited at any time.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Within edsembli SIS, schools can track the compulsory credits for graduation for each completed course. As this information is calculated by PASI and the information recorded in this area of edsembli is not sent to PASI, it is also editable.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Editing a course will present the following interface:</p>

  <h2>The following fields are available for an Alberta student’s completed courses:</h2>
  <h3><a name="Completed_course" id="Completed_course"></a> Completed course</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date</span>: Year and month of completion are recorded.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Course, Title, Course grade, PASI code</span>: Indicates the course the student completed. The title, grade and PASI code are all attributes of the course and are automatically set based on the course.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">School mark</span>: The school mark value for the course.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exam mark</span>: The diploma exam mark value for the course.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final mark</span>: The final mark value assigned to a student for a course. PASI will accept mark values between 0 to 100 or one of the following code values:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">A = A letter grade</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">B = B letter grade</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">C - C letter grade</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">D = D letter grade (Valid until 1995/1996 school year)</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">F = Fail</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 80px;">P = Pass</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Credits attempted</span>: Indicates the credits of the course that would be applied to the student if successfully completed the course. This value is based on the credits of the class that was in the student’s timetable.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Credits earned</span>: Indicates the credits that the student has earned.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">School completed in</span>: Indicates the school where the course was taken. Only schools in the table of schools are available for selection.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../alberta/PASI_Code_Values.html#EvaluationMethod" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Evaluation method</span> <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/opennew.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:20px;" /></a>: Indicates the method used to determine the student’s final mark. This field is only reported to PASI when the student has an evaluated mark. An evaluated mark is a mark assigned to a student for a course that was taken outside Alberta’s learning systems. If the course was not taken outside of the Alberta learning system, it will appear as “N/A – AB defined course”. If an Evaluated Mark is to be entered, schools must select a value from the Evaluation Method Table.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../alberta/PASI_Code_Values.html#CourseEnrolmentStatus" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Course enrolment status</span> <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/opennew.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:20px;" /></a>: Indicates the status of a course enrolment. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: this field is tracked by PASI as part of the data for a student’s course enrolment, and is updated automatically in PASI when the student drops a class or completes the class. When it is posted to the transcript, it will have the value Completed.</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Funded</span>: Identifies that the course enrolment should be considered during funding related processes. This is a yes/no field and will be set to Yes automatically when the course is automatically added by the school at the end of the course.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">External credential</span>: Identifies that the course enrolment should be considered for eligibility for credentials not offered by Alberta Education (e.g. the Green Certificate). This is a Yes/No field.  </p>
  <h3>Course details</h3>
  <p>The fields in the course details area will be automatically populated based on the information defined for the class that was in the student’s timetable. For Provincially Defined Courses, with PASI Course Mark Integration enabled, this information may not be modified for the student.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../alberta/PASI_Code_Values.html#InstructionalLanguage"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Language of instruction</span> <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/opennew.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:20px;" /></a>: Indicates the language used when providing instruction for a class section.</p>

  <h3>Course attendance</h3>
  <p>Attendance information is automatically recorded when the course is automatically added. Attendance information will only be available if the school is recording class attendance (rather than AM/PM attendance).<br />
      </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Absent</span>: The number of times the student was absent.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Excused</span>: The number of times the student was excused.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Late</span>: The number of times the student was late.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Possible</span>: The number of times the class was taught and the student was expected to attend.</p>
  <h3>Compulsory credits for graduation requirements</h3>
  <p>PASI has the student’s official transcript and is responsible for the official determination of whether a student has fulfilled all the necessary credits for graduation.<br />
      <br />
    edsembli SIS also offers the ability to track graduation requirements, including the ability to consider credits not yet completed. If using edsembli’s graduation requirements, each completed course will have a category that is used to automatically determine whether the course is compulsory. For most situations, this area does not get changed from the defaults. See <a href="achievement-grad-reqmts.htm">Graduation requirements</a> for more information on how this information is used.<br />
      </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Category</span>: This will default the category assigned to the course code. This is the category that should be used but it may be changed for this student if required. In Alberta, the category is based on the value in the ‘course subject(s)’ field of the code.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Main category group / Automatically determined</span>: In some graduation requirements, a course may fulfil credit requirement in more than one requirement area. This area is typically not changed from the defaulted category group and yes to Automatically determined. Below is an example to show how these settings are used:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A student may be required to fulfil these 2 requirements as part of their diploma (fictitious):</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="margin-left:20px;">- 1 credit in French or Native language or international language<span style="margin-left:32px">(main category group called Another Language).</span></span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="margin-left:20px;">- 1 credit in a French course (main category group called French)</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The student’s course has the French category and it could therefore fulfil the requirements of either of the 2 possible main category groups. If the Automatically determined field is set to Yes, each modification to the student’s completed courses (e.g. new courses added) will give the program the ability to set the main category group to the group that best fits the student’s needs. If it is set to No, you can select the specific category group. Yes is the recommended setting.</p>
