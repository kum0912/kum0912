<h1>Adult Indigenous language instruction</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p></p>
 <p>The Adult Indigenous language instruction 
 option provides Ontario schools and boards with the ability to generate 
 the official Register of Enrolment in Adult Indigenous language Instruction. 
 This is a classroom-based register used to record enrolment and attendance 
 for all Continuing Education (CE) pupils enrolled in adult indigenous 
 language non-credit courses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This register option is available to Ontario boards and schools set 
 up with ‘<a href="../setup/setup-school-configuration.htm">school operating 
 type</a>’ of continuing education or summer school.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The courses must be provided through classroom instruction:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>During the school year</li>
	<li>In the summer</li>
	<li>From September to August  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Adult indigenous language non-credit courses may be offered during or 
 after the school day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This register may include continuing education pupils enrolled in adult 
 indigenous language non-credit courses. It must not include full or part-time 
 day school pupils.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Schools and boards should be familiar with the official Ministry enrolment 
 register instructions for continuing education programs. These instructions 
 are updated annually on the Ministry’s site</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html" target="_blank">http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html. 
  </a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please be familiar with the <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a> option in the student’s record. This 
 will provide detailed information on the enrolment register(s) the student 
 will appear on. Hint: on the FTE and/or ADE card in the student’s record, 
 there’s a Details section that may be expanded to show info on how FTE/ADE 
 is calculated, and how the student’s data impacts the register. <span style="font-style: italic;">Adult indigenous language non-credit classes 
 are reported as ADE.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Set up classes that need to appear on the Register of Enrolment in 
 Adult Indigenous Language Instruction</h4>
<p>There are no Ministry defined course codes for non-credit adult indigenous 
 language instruction courses.  A <a href="../setup/setup-class-courses.htm">course</a> 
 will need to exist, using any course code that is appropriate for the 
 board/school. It may be a generic INDLANG course, or multiple course codes 
 may be created for each indigenous language course taught.  A class 
 will need to be created for each unique group of students enrolled in 
 an adult indigenous language course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a class is to appear in the Adult Indigenous Language Instruction 
 register, it must be set up (<a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Setup 
 &gt; Class info &gt; Classes</a>) as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The language of instruction must be one of the following (Ministry code 
 must be set up correctly by the board using <a href="../setup/setup-languages-of-instruction.htm">Setup 
 &gt; Class info &gt; Languages of Instruction</a>):</p>
<p> </p>
<table style="border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" cellspacing="0" width="100%" border="1">
	<colgroup><col style="width: 50%;"/>
	<col style="width: 50%;"/>

</tbody></table>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The course offering type must be set to:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Adult Indigenous Language Instruction</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Enter the most appropriate Delivery and Course delivery type</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Since funding is based on attendance, make sure that the class 
	 schedule, start and end dates, and period times are accurate.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Make sure each student’s add/drop dates are accurate (add date is the 
 first day attending the class, drop date is the first date of non-attendance 
 in the class).</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Teachers track classroom attendance</h4>
<p>Teachers are responsible for taking accurate classroom attendance, just 
 like any regular class.  The class schedule, start/end dates, and 
 the school’s calendar will define what dates the teacher is expected to 
 take attendance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Cancelled instructional sessions – Funded cancelled session “C”</h4>
<p>Where an instructional session has been cancelled owing to exceptional 
 circumstances (such as bad weather or an emergency) and the instructor 
 is paid, the session will be recognized for funding purposes. These sessions 
 are included in the total number of sessions recognized for funding. The 
 funded cancelled session must be marked with a “C” on the register and 
 the reason for the cancellation must be recorded. To cancel a funded session, 
 follow these instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use Attendance &gt; Enter attendance &gt; Group Excursion.  Select 
 the date and group of students (e.g. all students or a specific class).</p>
<p>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, scroll 
 down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select the option 
 select the option c Cancelled.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Record an attendance note describing the reason for the cancellation.</li>
	<li>Apply (save) the attendance for the group.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: If the “C” session is rescheduled, 
 the instructor should not be paid for the rescheduled session and the 
 rescheduled session must not be included in the total number of sessions 
 recognized for funding purposes. See Rescheduled instructional sessions.</span></p>
<h4>Cancelled instructional sessions – Unfunded cancelled session “D”</h4>
<p>Where an instructional session has been cancelled (I.e. the teacher 
 is unavailable) and the instructor is not paid, the session will not be 
 recognized for funding purposes. Do not include this session in the total 
 number of sessions recognized for funding. The unfunded cancelled session 
 must be marked with a “D” on the register and the reason for the cancellation 
 must be recorded. To cancel an unfunded session, follow these instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use Attendance &gt; Enter attendance &gt; Group Excursion.  Select 
 the date and group of students (e.g. a specific class).</p>
<p>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, scroll 
 down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select the option 
 select the option $ Cancelled Not Funded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note: If the “D” session is rescheduled, the instructor should be paid 
 for the rescheduled session and the rescheduled session must be included 
 in the total number of sessions recognized for funding purposes.</p>
<h4>Rescheduled sessions  </h4>
<p>If a new session is to be added to the class, typically the class end 
 date is extended to accommodate the extra session. This is done using 
 <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Setup &gt; Class info &gt; 
 Classes</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the rescheduled session is due to a session that is given the code 
 “C” (funded cancelled session), the instructor should not be paid for 
 the rescheduled session and the rescheduled session must not be included 
 in the total number of sessions recognized for funding purposes. To reschedule 
 a session, and have it not appear in the register, follow these instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Use <a href="../attendance/att-enter-groupex.htm">Attendance &gt; 
	 Enter attendance &gt; Group/excursion</a>.  Select the date and 
	 group of students (e.g. All students or a specific class).<br/>
	</li>
	<li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, 
	 scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select 
	 the option select the option ^ Non-instructional Day<br/>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Record an attendance note describing the reason the class is removed 
	 from the register (e.g. rescheduled session for the mm/yyyy funded 
	 cancelled session due to weather).<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Apply (save) the attendance for the group.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Generate the Register of Enrolment in Adult Indigenous Language Instruction</h2>
<p>To access the register, select Ontario reporting &gt; Enrolment registers 
 &gt; Adult indigenous language instruction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-indig-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:201px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The form will look like this:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-indig-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:596px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The list of classes will default any classes that are set up to appear 
 on this register. You may limit the classes using the filters, or select 
 an individual or range of classes to print.  A separate register 
 is generated for each selected class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the Print button located at the bottom of the form. Once the 
 report has been submitted to the task queue, you may leave this application 
 or generate other reports. You will receive notification when your report 
 is ready. Reports are saved in <a href="../setup/setup-file-manager.htm">file 
 manager</a> under Provincial &gt; Enrolment registers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Hint: See previously created registers 
 by selecting the folder icon to open file manager at this location.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The info generated on the register may also be exported in a CSV file 
 by checking the option shown below. The CSV file will be generated along 
 with the register report, as part of the submission to the task queue. 
   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-course-grant-export.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:280px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example of the register report:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-indig-report.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:796px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The top of the report will include the register name, school year, class 
 (course code &amp; section letter and course title).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-indig-report1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:632px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each pupil in the class, it will include the following info from 
 the student’s record (in the Personal area):</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-indig-report2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:432px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘OP’ column will show  OP (Other Pupil) if the student’s ‘student 
 board residence status’ does not use ministry code 01, 06, 07, or 09. 
  If a student is an “Other Pupil”, their sessions will not be recognized 
 for funding. All pupils of the board are funded and their attendance sessions 
 are included in the non-credit ADE calculations. Full-time and part-time 
 day school pupils cannot appear on these registers so they should not 
 be enrolled in these classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To the right of the student info it will show the student’s attendance 
 at sessions. This info is based on the entry of attendance by the teachers. 
 The dates are based on the setup of the class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-indig-report3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:722px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each date, a blank will appear if the student is present.  If 
 the student was not present at the session, one of the following 4 codes 
 will appear:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
	<li>Pupil absence from a session</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li style="list-style: url(dashbullet.png);">Late admission or early 
	 withdrawal (based on the student’s class add/drop dates)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
	<li>Funded cancelled session</li>
	<li>Unfunded cancelled session</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>* if the student is absent 3 or more consecutive sessions, these absences 
 are not funded (they are excluded from total). Cancelled sessions (“C” 
 or “D”) do not ‘break’ the consecutive absent count.  For example, 
 if a student had 5 consecutive absences in a row (Sept 26 to Oct 15), 
 as well as 3 consecutive absences on Jan 30, Feb 6 and Feb 11. The cancelled 
 session on Feb 4 does not count as a consecutive absence, but it also 
 does not break the count of consecutive absences. Therefore, if there 
 was a possible 40 sessions that the student could attend, the school will 
 receive funding for 32 sessions (40 - 5 - 3 = 32).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the student details page, a summary page is included with an area 
 for the principal to certify the register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-indig-report4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:684px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Hours per session’ is based on the daily average minutes of instruction 
 set up for the class (using Setup &gt; Class info &gt; Classes). This 
 may be based on period times, or it may be manually entered directly into 
 the daily average minutes of instruction field. The minutes will be converted 
 to hours on this register.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Funding - OnSIS reporting of classes on the Continuing Education Registers</h3>
<p>Funding allocation is based on pupil attendance.  Continuing education 
 pupils may be included on this register. This register must not include 
 pupils enrolled s full-time or part-time in a publicly funded day school 
 on the October/March enrolment-count date.  Other Pupils are not 
 eligible for funding for adult indigenous language non-credit courses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Funding is based on the information submitted to OnSIS.  Refer 
 to <a href="on-onsis-coned-night-school.htm">OnSIS &gt; Night/continuing 
 education school &gt; ConEd/Night school info</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the Ministry’s instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Elemental data is collected once a 
 year on August 31 for the entire school year (September-August). Submit 
 data through the Continuing Education and/or Summer School submissions 
 (School Special Condition Type “N – Continuing Education” or “8 – Summer”) 
 .</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>ADE to be reported (by each course) by Course Offering Type for each 
 student:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Adult Indigenous Language must be 
	 reported for all students enrolled.  </p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">The following information must be reported:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Course Offering • Indigenous Language 
	  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Program Start Date  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Program Finish Date  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Time of day: “Start Time” and “End 
	 Time”  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">ADE September to June  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">ADE Summer  </p></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Date and Time information is required to 
 differentiate between duplicate records should the pupil take the same 
 program more than once.  </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The corresponding ADE value must also 
 be reported for each course in the “ADE – September to June” or “ADE – 
 Summer” field.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ADE calculations for classes on the Continuing Education Credit Courses 
 registers</h3>
<p>The calculation of the average daily enrolment (ADE) is calculated as 
 follows:</p>
<p>ADE = # of sessions recognized for funding x hours per session / 950</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other reports</h3>
<p>Continuing education schools may also want to consider running these 
 options:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="on-coned-coned-ade.htm">Ontario 
 reporting &gt; Continuing education &gt; Continuing education ADE</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This generates the OnSIS continuing education enrolment detail and summary 
 report showing average daily enrolment (ADE) info for continuing education 
 or summer school students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="on-ereg-course-list-grant.htm" style="font-weight: bold;">Ontario 
 reporting &gt; Enrolment registers &gt; Course lists for grant purposes</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This generates class by class details of each register, showing total 
 ADE by register and for the school/board.</p>
