<p> </p>
<p>These concepts set the foundation for understanding scheduling. This 
 is also where you might find some helpful advice that may be referenced 
 if the situation applies to your school (e.g. classes during lunch/before 
 or after school).</p>
<h4><a id="This_year_vs_next_year"></a>This year vs next year</h4>
<p>The school may plan for the next school year without interfering in 
 any way with the operation of the current school year.  This is possible 
 because there is distinct ‘this year’ vs ‘next year’ school information 
 for</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Courses</li>
	<li>Classes (aka the master timetable)</li>
	<li>Semester/term/day/period setup</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Every student and staff member has a <a href="../students/enrolment-students.htm">school 
 year status</a> that identifies whether the student/teacher is attending 
 the school this year and/or next year.  If the status contains the 
 word ‘next’, the person is expected at the school next year and will be 
 considered in the scheduling processes. For example, next year students 
 will have one of these checked statuses:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-registered.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:273px;" border="0"/> 
  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Based on these statuses, students attending the school next year will 
 have distinct ‘next year’ information for their:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Grade</li>
	<li>Timetable (classes)</li>
	<li>Homeroom</li>
	<li>Advisor group</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
Staff attending next year will have distinct &#39;next year&#39; information for 
 their assigned:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Classes</li>
	<li>Homerooms</li>
	<li>Advisor groups</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="Initialize_next_year_prior_to_doing_anything"></a>Initialize 
 next year prior to doing anything</h4>
<p>Before starting to work on anything related to next school year, run 
 the ‘Initialize next year’ process  This step can be done any time 
 in the school year, but typically schools will run it in December/January 
 before the students begin their course selections.  This step will 
 copy over courses, classes, homerooms, and advisor groups from this year 
 into next year, and it will advance the students’ next years grades.  See 
 <a href="sched-initialize-scheduling.htm">Scheduling &gt; Prepare for 
 next year &gt; Initialize next year</a> for more information.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><a id="Add_new_students_staff"></a>Add new students/staff</h4>
<p>At any time you may add new students and staff to the school. It is 
 important to set the school year status to ‘Next year only’ to reflect 
 the fact that they are only attending your school next year (and not this 
 year).   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Students may be added using the options under Student tools &gt; Add 
 new student.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="../students/add-new-student.htm">Add student</a>:  Use 
 this to manually add one student at a time into the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="../students/enrol-from-this-board.htm">Enrol students from 
 this board/division</a>:  Use this to automatically add a group of 
 students from another school who have this school set as their destination 
 school (e.g. to enrol students from the feeder elementary school). </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="../students/manage-online-reg.htm">Manage online registrations</a>: 
 Use this to automatically enrol students who have entered registration 
 info using the school&#39;s online application.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Similarly, new staff to the schools may be added using Staff tools &gt; 
 Add new staff &gt; Add staff.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><a id="Students_and_staff_who_are_not_returning_next_year"></a>Students 
 and staff who are not returning next year</h4>
<p>Set the school year status to “This year only” for those students and 
 staff who are not returning to the school next year.  By doing this, 
 these individuals will not be considered in the scheduling processes. 
  </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><a id="Course_selections"></a>Course selections</h4>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Not applicable to elementary schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course selections represent the courses that the student would like 
 to take in the next school year. Each course selection is set as a preferred 
 course or an alternate course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Preferred courses: The courses that the 
 student would prefer to have in their timetable next year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p>Alternate courses: The courses that the student would like to take if 
 unable to get into a preferred course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each preferred course has an optional check box for “Can this course 
 be substituted with an alternate?”. The automatic process for creating 
 the students’ timetables (called ‘load students’) has an option to allow 
 the automatic replacement of a preferred courses with an alternate course 
 rather than leave the student with a conflict in their timetable.  This 
 replacement functionality will only happen if the preferred course is 
 set to yes for “can this course be substituted with an alternate”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the school grants student access to edit course selections online, 
 the school may optionally lock specific courses so that they may not be 
 removed by the student.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hint: Some schools create placeholder courses that are not official 
 courses. For example, if a student wants to complete all their credit 
 requirements in semesters 1, the school may set up a placeholder course 
 called &#39;NOSEM2&#39; and create a class &#39;NOSEM2a&#39; that occupies semester 2, 
 all periods. Students with this course selection will have all other courses 
 scheduled into semester 1 since semester 2 is occupied with the placeholder 
 course.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><a id="Semester_term___day_period_sets_and_patterns__"></a>Semester/term 
 &amp; day/period sets and patterns  </h4>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not applicable 
 to elementary schools.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is imperative that you make sure your semester term and day/period 
 sets and patterns are defined correctly (<a href="sem-term-day-period.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Prepare for next year &gt; Sem/term/day/period</a>).  For 
 example, do not have a set semester/term set called ‘Semestered’ that 
 contains patterns for Sem 1, Sem 2, and Full year.  The automatic 
 scheduler is free to assign a class with the ‘Semestered’ set into any 
 one of those 3 patterns, which is not a desirable outcome.  Different 
 sets would be most appropriate for this scenario (set for ‘semestered’ 
 and a different set for ‘full year’).</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Good</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/good.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:356px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Not good</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/bad.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:161px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Similarly, carefully examine the day/period sets and patterns.  For 
 example, do not have one set defined that has patterns for single periods 
 and double periods in the same set.  If a class is assigned to this 
 incorrectly defined set, classes may end up being assigned in single periods 
 when you really wanted them to be assigned in a double period.  By 
 making these 2 distinct sets, any automatic assignment of a pattern will 
 be limited to only the applicable patterns in that set.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><a id="Grouped_classes"></a>Grouped classes</h4>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not applicable 
 to elementary schools (although this feature is available).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sometimes, a teacher is responsible for teaching more than 1 course 
 during a period (e.g. a grade 10 and 11 physical education class are taught 
 at the same time by the same teacher). Use the ‘Grouped classes’ field 
 (<a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">available when editing a class</a>) 
 for this situation to ensure all the classes stay together with the same 
 teacher, room and schedule.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><a id="Consider_a_snapshot_before_doing_anything"></a>Snapshots</h4>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not applicable 
 to elementary schools.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A snapshot is a copy of the next year&#39;s classes. Snapshots can be created 
 and restored, allowing you to experiment with different class schedules 
 knowing that you can return to saved snapshot at anytime. See <a href="shed-snapshots.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Snapshots</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><a id="Lock_class_schedules_where_needed"></a>Lock class schedules 
 where needed</h4>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not applicable 
 to elementary schools.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You may lock the semester/term pattern and/or the day/period pattern 
 for any class by selecting the lock/unlock icon (<a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">while 
 editing the class</a>).  If you want to ensure that a class remains 
 in a specific semester, then lock the semester/term pattern.  Similarly, 
 if you want to ensure that a class remains in a specific period, then 
 lock the day/period pattern.  The automatic scheduling tool will 
 not change those setting if they are locked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/lockclasses.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:779px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hint: Some schools create placeholder courses and classes and lock them 
 into specific patterns in order to manipulate where real classes may be 
 scheduled. Here are some examples:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>If a teacher is only available to teach in the morning, assign 
	 the teacher to a placeholder class that is locked into the afternoon 
	 periods. All other classes for this teacher will be forced into the 
	 morning periods. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>If a room is not available during specific periods, assign the 
	 room to a placeholder class that is locked into the unavailable periods. 
	 (Note: if the class has a special schedule rather than patterns, it 
	 will be treated as if it is locked).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Some schools create PREP classes as placeholders for a teacher&#39;s 
	 prep period. These are not locked so that the scheduler will find 
	 a location in the timetable for the teacher&#39;s prep class. These placeholders 
	 are not necessary because the automatic scheduler provides a setting 
	 for the maximum number of periods/day a teacher can teach. If placeholders 
	 are used, it may be necessary to create one placeholder class per 
	 teacher per semester (and remember to adjust the value of the maximum 
	 period/day in the automatic scheduler so that it allows all periods).</li>
</ul>
<h4><a id="Multiple_rooms__multiple_schedules__special_schedule"></a>Multiple 
 rooms, multiple schedules, special schedule</h4>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not applicable 
 to elementary schools.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are some advanced features for classes that may apply in some 
 situations.  Please use these special features only where needed, 
 as they may make it difficult for other classes to be scheduled if they 
 are used incorrectly.  These features are typically only used when 
 a master timetable is build completely by hand without the use of any 
 tools, and the timetable is provided to the office for entry into the 
 SIS. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> When editing a class, use the MULTIPLE ROOMS tab if the room of 
 the class is not the same every time it is taught. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the MULTIPLE SCHEDULES REQUIRED button to add another schedule to 
 a class if the schedule is unique (e.g. a full year class is changing 
 from period 1 in semester 1 to period 3 in semester 2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Set the &#39;Does this class have a special schedule&quot; Yes/No field 
 to Yes if the class schedule is random and doesn’t fit into any definable 
 pattern.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>See the <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">setup of classes</a> 
 for more info on these features.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><a id="Classes_offered_during_lunch__"></a>Classes offered during 
 lunch  </h4>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not applicable 
 to elementary schools.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sometimes a school may offer a few classes over the lunch.  Using 
 an example where most students have 2 regular periods before lunch, and 
 2 regular periods after lunch, and some students have classes during lunch, 
 here are some approaches to handle classes offered during lunch. The same 
 approach can be applied to classes offered before or after school:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Lunch classes do not need to appear in a 
 lunch period and ‘by period’ attendance is not required:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the lunch classes do not need to appear in the timetable in a specific 
 lunch period, and if ‘by period’ attendance is not required for these 
 classes, consider scheduling these classes into no period.  Create 
 a <a href="sem-term-day-period.htm">day/period set</a> called floater 
 (or whatever name you’d like to use), with one pattern called floater, 
 and that pattern has no periods selected.  Schedule the lunch classes 
 into the floater set/pattern (by editing the class).  These floater 
 classes will appear as one of the student’s additional classes in their 
 timetable (listed below the regular classes in the timetable grid).  These 
 lunch classes may be flagged as reportable so that achievement information 
 may be recorded for them if appropriate.  These classes will never 
 conflict with other classes and they will never get assigned to any other 
 period by master builder - automatic.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lunch classes need to appear in the 
 timetable in a specific lunch period and/or ‘by period’ attendance is 
 required:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a specific period is required for lunch classes, this lunch period 
 may be introduced into the schedule at the start of the scheduling process, 
 or at the end of the scheduling process.   </p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
	<li>Lunch period is introduced at the start of the scheduling process 
	 by <a href="sem-term-day-period.htm">setting the number of periods 
	 per day</a> to include the lunch period (e.g. 5 period per day).  All 
	 day/period patterns for regular (non-lunch) classes do not have the 
	 lunch period checked off (e.g. no pattern has period 3 checked off). 
	  A day/period set is defined specifically for the lunch period. 
	 <a href="sem-term-day-period.htm">Create a day/period set</a> called 
	 lunch (or whatever name you’d like to use), with one pattern called 
	 lunch, and that pattern has period 3 selected.  Schedule the 
	 lunch classes into the lunch set/pattern (by editing the class).  These 
	 classes will never conflict with regular classes and they will never 
	 get assigned to any other period by master builder - automatic.  These 
	 lunch classes will automatically appear in a student’s timetable if 
	 the student has it in their course selections. NOTE:  do not 
	 specify the lunch period in Prepare for next year &gt; Lunches.  If 
	 period 3 is added as a lunch period, the students will not be scheduled 
	 into these lunch classes because it is reserving period 3 for a lunch 
	 break.</li>
</ol>
<p>  </p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style: lower-roman;">
	<li>Lunch may be introduced at the end of the scheduling process if 
	 the school would prefer to schedule without the lunch period (e.g. 
	 4 period day).  Once the timetable is done, the school changes 
	 to a 5 period day.  All patterns need to be examined carefully 
	 and modified as needed.  For example, a pattern for period 4 
	 (under the old 4 period schedule) may need to be renamed to period 
	 5 and the check box for period 4 is removed while period 5 is checked 
	 off.  Similarly, the period 3 pattern (under the old 4 period 
	 day) may need to be renamed to period 4 and the check boxes for only 
	 period 4 are selected.  By changing the patterns, the classes 
	 will automatically have the renamed patterns and the timetables will 
	 adjust to the new periods.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Once all the regular classes are in the new 
 periods, assign the lunch pattern (a set/pattern specifically for period 
 3) to the lunch classes.  After the schedule is done, add the classes 
 to the student’s timetable using the add classes tool, or by editing the 
 timetables of each student individually.   </p>
