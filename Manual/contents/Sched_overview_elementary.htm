<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>edsembli SIS includes powerful scheduling tools to help elementary schools 
 roll over to a new school year, including grade advancement, assignment 
 of new homerooms, and the addition of classes into the students timetables.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most elementary schools now have classes in the students timetable based 
 on the subjects that appear on the report card.  Elementary students 
 are typically assigned into a homeroom and the homeroom teacher is typically 
 the teacher responsible for the core subjects. The tools for creating 
 classes and assigning student timetables are available for next year (via 
 the Scheduling next year options described here), or for this year if 
 classes are assigned after the year end roll over.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following outline shows the steps involved during the scheduling 
 process, including the assignment of classes to students to build their 
 next year&#39;s timetables. In addition to these steps, be sure to read the 
 <a href="Scheduling_important_concepts.htm">Important concepts</a> section 
 to help understand terminology and how to record new students/staff attending 
 next year or leaving at the end of this year. Only these sections apply 
 to elementary schools:</p>

<p><a href="Scheduling_important_concepts.htm#Students_and_staff_who_are_not_returning_next_year">Student 
 and staff who are not returning next year</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before following these steps, it is important to know which approach 
 best fits your schools needs. The steps are different depending upon the 
 approach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="sched-elem-approach-a.htm">Approach 
 A:  Classes are created using the ASSIGNED CLASSES feature in homerooms</a> 
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the recommended approach for elementary schools where all students 
 in the homeroom have the same timetable (or at least many of their classes 
 are the same).  This approach clears out the classes and then the new classes are 
 created within the homeroom setup. As students are assigned to the homeroom, 
 they are automatically assigned into the classes.  This means that 
 timetables are automatically created for new students, and if a student 
 changes homerooms, their timetable is automatically adjusted. <br/>
<br/>
Approach A involves these steps:<br/>
<br/>
A1. Prepare for next year</p>
 <p>A2. Remove all elementary classes</p>
<p>A3. Setup homerooms and their assigned classes</p>
<p>A4. Assign students to homerooms</p>
<p>A5. Define class schedule</p>
<p>A6. Assign other classes to students</p>
<p>A7. Advisor groups (optional)</p>
<p>A8. Print timetables (optional)</p>
<p>A9. Year-end roll over</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="sched-elem-approach-b.htm">Approach 
 B:  Classes are created using the traditional setup of classes</a></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">With this approach, schools can use the 
 familiar set up of classes to create all the classes for next school year. 
  Then the &#39;assign students to classes&#39; tools can quickly add the 
 classes to the student&#39;s timetables.  With this approach, student 
 timetables are never automatically updated to reflect the classes that 
 are assigned to the students in the homeroom. As new students are added 
 to the school and they are assigned to a homeroom, the student&#39;s timetable 
 will be empty until the classes are added. </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Approach B involves these steps:</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p>B1. Prepare for next year</p>
<p>B2. Setup classes</p>
<p>B3. Setup homerooms</p>
<p>B4. Assign students to homerooms</p>
<p>B5. Assign students to classes</p>
<p>B6. Advisor groups (optional)</p>
<p>B7. Print timetables (optional)</p>
<p>B8. Year-end roll over</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: The steps for each approach may be 
 varied to match the school&#39;s characteristics and preferences. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">If the school also includes secondary school 
 grades using traditional high school scheduling features, we would suggest 
 that any constraints on the timetable for these shared elementary and 
 secondary teachers/rooms be added to the classes table so that the secondary 
 scheduling will take them into account.  If there are no constraints, 
 it is possible to leave these classes as floater classes (not assigned 
 a period), and then they can be scheduled around the secondary school 
 subjects.</p>
