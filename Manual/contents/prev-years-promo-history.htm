<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>The Promotion history option in a student’s record provides a quick 
 summary of each previous school year. This includes information from all 
 schools within the school board/division/district, as well as the student’s 
 grade at the end of the year, their homeroom teacher, and whether they 
 were promoted/retained/or transferred, along with attendance totals for 
 that school year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The promotion history is automatically recorded as part of the year-end 
 roll over process (transfer to current). Since this information is not 
 required, historical information (prior to using edsembli SIS) may be 
 optionally added manually at any time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This information is available for current, past and future students, 
 and is student-specific, which means the information is the same regardless 
 of the school that the student attends. Only the school that is the edsembli 
 record owner can edit the student’s promotion history.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Promotion history menu option is located in the Achievement submenu</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/ach-promo-history1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:337px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once selected, the Promotion history card, becomes available.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Promotion_history" id="Promotion_history"></a>Promotion history</h2>
<p>The Promotion history card will list the student’s promotion history 
 in reverse chronological order. In most instances, this card is for 
 information purposes and does not require any editing. </p>
