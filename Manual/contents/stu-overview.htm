<h2><a name="Student_records" id="Student_records"></a>Student record access</h2>
<p>There are 2 ways to access a student’s record from the dashboard:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li> select the Menu icon in the left corner, then select Student 
	 records from the menu.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/select-student1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:455px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>select the student records icon from the student records card located 
	 on the dashboard<br/>
	<br/>
	<img src="assets/images/sturec-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:576px;" border="0"/></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The select student page will appear using either method.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<h2><a name="Select_a_student" id="Select_a_student"></a>Select a student</h2>
<p>Enter as much or as little of the student’s name as you want then select 
 the search button or Enter key. For example, enter ‘B’ for a list of students 
 whose surnames start with B, or enter ‘Babcock’ for a list of students 
 whose surnames start with Babcock. If you know the student’s usual name 
 (e.g. of Joshua’s usual name is Joe), enter ‘Babcock, Joe’ to go directly 
 to the student record. Your search may show multiple students matching 
 the search name, so make sure you select the right student.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Hint: enter % for a list of all students.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="assets/images/search.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:797px;" border="0"/></p>
<p><br/>
Every student in edsembli SIS has a student record like this:<br/>
</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/student-record.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:971px;" border="0"/></p>
<h3><br/>
<a name="Menu" id="Menu"></a>Menu</h3>
<p>The student&#39;s record represents a single access point for the information 
 recorded for the student. The information is broken down into areas based 
 on the type of information recorded for the student. Using the menu on 
 the left, the content will change to reflect the menu option selected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The student records menu can be hidden or shown by selecting the icon 
 in the top right corner of the student&#39;s profile. The same icon is now 
 used for show vs hide, however the tool tip will correctly indicate whether 
 selecting the icon will hide the menu, or show the menu. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: this 
 icon will appear in the toolbar on smaller devices.</span><br/>
</p>
<table width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td width="48"><img alt="" src="assets/images/stu-menu-on.jpg" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:34px"/></td>
		<td>Use this icon to show or hide the student record menu and profile 
		 area.</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
   
<br/>Student records has an advanced search feature that lets 
 you search for a specific area in the student’s record (e.g. locker). 
 
<br/>Enter criteria beside the Search icon and results will 
 automatically display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="assets/images/stu-sturec-search.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:355px;" border="0"/><br/>
<br/>
For further information on menus, see <a href="../startup/start-common-features.htm">Menus 
 in Common Features</a>. 
<h3><a name="App_bar" id="App_bar"></a>App bar</h3>
<p>The App bar for Student records appears across the top of the student’s 
 record. Use the Main menu icon in the top left corner to navigate to other 
 areas of edsembli SIS (e.g. leave the student records area).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are some convenient icons in the top right corner:</p>
<p> </p>
<table width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td style="vertical-align: top;"><img alt="" src="assets/images/stu-mag-glass.png" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:25px"/></td>
		<td>The Select student icon calls up the Select Student screen.</td>

		<td>The Previous student and Next student icons move (step) to 
		 the next or previous student in the list of resulting students 
		 (e.g. the students matching the search criteria used to find this 
		 student).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> </td>
		<td> </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align: top;"><img alt="" src="assets/images/stu-launch.png" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:28px"/> </td>
		<td>The New window icon lets you keep your existing browser window 
		 (tab) open while opening a new browser tab with 3 possible options. 
		  The options will appear when the icon is selected as shown 
		 here: 
		<br/>   
		<br/><img src="assets/images/open-new.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:153px;" border="0"/> 
		<br/>   
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New student</span>: takes

		 selected</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dashboard</span>:  takes 
		 you to the initial dashboard page that appears when you first 
		 log into the SIS</p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Duplicate student</span>:  creates 
		 another browser session with the same student information (creates 
		 a duplicate of the page you were looking at). This is handy because 
		 you can have multiple student records open at the same time or 
		 look at different parts of the same student&#39;s record at the side 
		 by side.. </p>
		   
		<br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hint: browser 
		 tabs can be maximized or restored down to smaller sizes so that 
		 they can be repositioned side by side.</span></td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><br style="margin-left: 40px;"/>
</p>
<h3><a name="Profile" id="Profile"></a>Profile</h3>
<p>The student Profile area contains the student’s picture, and other pertinent 
 information for easy reference. Pictures are usually imported annually, 
 but if a student’s picture is not available or needs updating, click the 
 student picture area to select an image from your source.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Hint: to quickly see 
 the student photo in its full saved size, right click a student’s picture, 
 then choose Open image in a new tab. This works only in Chrome browser.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The profile area shows the student’s usual names and legal names. Usual 
 names appear first and are formatted as Usual Name and Surname. Legal 
 names are displayed second, in a smaller font, and are formatted as legal 
 surname, given name + middle name(s) + , suffix (if applicable).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Student flags</span> (coloured circles) 
 appear under the student’s picture. Students may be flagged with a school 
 defined flag (colour, optional flashing, title) using the Flags menu option 
 under Enrolment. Hovering over the flag will show the title assigned to 
 the flag.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/stu-flags.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:255px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Status</span> is a quick way to organize 
 students based on when they are attending or have attended this school. 
 Every student is assigned a status reflective of the student’s enrolment 
 at the school being accessed. The following statuses are available</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">This year and next year:</span> student 
 is actively attending school this year and is scheduled to attend school 
 next year. * 
<br/>   
<br/><strong>This year only:</strong> student is actively 
 attending school this year but is not scheduled to attend this school 
 next year. *<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Next year only:</strong> student is attending this school next 
 year (e.g. new to the school next year). Next year only students show 
 next year grade and homeroom in profile 
<br/>   
<br/><strong>Withdrawn:</strong> Student was attending this 
 school year but has withdrawn from this school (sometimes referred to 
 as Deleted). 
<br/>   
<br/><strong>Past:</strong> Student attended the school in 
 previous years. 
<br/>   
<br/>* statuses are automatically updated to ‘This year only’ 
 for the students in the highest grade when the school commences the scheduling 
 process, and students not returning to the school are updated to &#39;past&#39; 
 at the end of the scheduling process. 
</blockquote>
<p>Additional profile area student information:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Provincial 
 student number:</span> (field name changes depending on your province 
 e.g. ASN for Alberta).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Student 
 No.:</span> Local student number for board/division/district identification.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grade:</span> 
 student’s current grade this school year</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Homeroom:</span> 
 student’s current homeroom designation, room number and teacher(s)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Birthdate 
 and age</span> (age in years will also include months for students aged 
 16 and younger).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gender:</span> 
 Male or female or other gender identifications if applicable</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Def. Chrs.:</span> 
 each student has 4 defined characters, represented by 4 0’s if not entered 
 for the student. The school defines what the 4 characters represent and 
 they are “secret” to the school in that only school staff know what they 
 mean. Each defined character may be a may be a letter A to Z, or a number 
 0 to 100. They are used as a quick means to identify groups of students. 
 For example, a bilingual school may use defined character 1 to represent 
 whether the student is English or French. Each student will have an E 
 or F recorded in the 1st defined character.</p>
   
<br/>You may see icons at the bottom of the student’s profile 
 that you can hover over to see tool tips. Here are some common ones.<br/>

<table width="100%">

<br/>Every student will have one of two edsembli record owner 
 icons (see below). As students move between schools in your board/district, 
 the student is still considered a single person with a single student 
 record; however, the individual pieces of information collected for the 
 student are considered either “student” or “school” data. 
<br/>   
<br/>Student data is stored once for the student and is shared 
 automatically with all attended schools. One school is considered the 
 edsembli record owner and only that school may edit that data. Example 
 student data includes name, birthdate, address, contacts, student numbers.<br/>
<br/>

<table width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="35"><img alt="" src="assets/images/record-owner-icon.png" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:22px"/></td>
		<td>The school <strong style="font-weight: normal;">is</strong> 
		 the edsembli record owner and the student’s profile will include 
		 this icon. The tool tip will show &quot;This school is the edsembli

	</tr>
</tbody></table>
   
<br/>School data is stored uniquely for each school and data 
 may be edited regardless of whether or not the school is the record owner. 
 Each school may edit the data as required. Example school data includes 
 grade, class info, school enrolment info, lockers, notes.<br/>
<br/>

<table width="100%">

<h3><a name="Content" id="Content"></a>Content</h3>
<p>Now that you understand the profile and app bar, the main content area 
 of the student’s record is where the student’s data will appear as you 
 navigate through different menu options.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Refer to the specific sections of the manuals for details on each menu 
 option, however, here is a brief overview. Please keep in mind that your 
 security rights will determine whether or not you have view or edit access 
 to specific areas of the student’s record.</p>
<h3><a name="Student_records_menu" id="Student_records_menu"></a>Student 
 records menu</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="stu-summary.htm" style="color: #000000;">Summary</a></span>: 
 This is a quick overview of the most commonly accessed information for 
 a student. The DETAILS button on each card provides a quick link to more 
 detailed information by taking you to that specific area in the student&#39;s 
 record.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="stu-personal-name.htm" style="color: #000000;">Personal</a></span>: 
 This is information that tends to be student-specific, in other words, 
 information that is the same regardless of what school the student attends. 
 Only the school that is considered the edsembli record owner can edit 
 this information. The Personal option has the following submenu options:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="stu-personal-name.htm" style="color: #000000;">Name</a></span>: Displays the student&#39;s usual 
 (preferred) and legal names, history of name changes, and aliases (AKA

<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="stu-family-contacts-contacts.htm" style="color: #000000;">Contacts</a></span>: Phone numbers, email 
 addresses, and current address information for the student’s contacts 
 (parents, custodians, guardians, emergency contacts, babysitter, etc). 
 Each contact is given a contact type (e.g. mother), and contacts are flagged 
 if they are the student’s legal guardian, custodian or non-custodial parent 
 (with or without access to student data). Contact types may be duplicated 
 (e.g. 2 mothers), and contact details with respect to Canada’s anti spam 
 legislation are tracked. Only the school that is considered the Maplewood 
 record owner can edit this information.</p>
