  <h1>Aggregate info</h1>
  <p>Aggregate data is a summary of information by category. For example, the number of children in each grade, by age or by gender. Specific, identifying information for each child is not collected. Private elementary students and students attending non-inspected private secondary schools are not issued OENs from the Ministry of Education, and therefore, OnSIS is only able to collect aggregate student data. The data is collected once a year, on October 31st.   </p>
  <p>This chart summarizes the OnSIS batch files required for non-inspected private schools:</p>

  <p>The OnSIS batch files containing aggregate info are available using the Aggregate info option as described here.  This card will only appear for schools <a href="on_onsis_private_schools.htm">configured</a> as non-inspected private schools.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/Aggregate_info_card.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 259px;" /></p>
  <p>This option is used to create batch files, using the CREATE button. The batch file is uploaded to OnSIS through the OnSIS web site.  Once OnSIS processes the batch file, a results file is created. The results file is downloaded from OnSIS and is then processed using the PROCESS RESULTS button.  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This section describes the Student info batch files. See the OnSIS Important concepts section for info on <a href="on-onsis-important-concepts.htm#Updating_data">Updating data in OnSIS using the ‘Create/Upload/Process’ cycle</a>. When the file is processed by OnSIS, typically there would not be any errors and therefore the PROCESS RESULTS functionality is generally not needed (e.g. any errors should be easily identifiable via the Ministry&#39;s application without the added steps of working with the results files in the edsembli SIS).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">Select the batch file(s) to be created and then select the CREATE BATCH  FILES option in the bottom footer of the application.  A PDF report is also created.  If the numbers in the PDF report are accurate, submit the file to OnSIS so that the numbers are automatically recorded in OnSIS (or manually enter the numbers directly into the OnSIS site).</p>
  <h2>Grade and age</h2>
  <h2>Permanent resident</h2>
  <h2>French as a second language</h2>
  <h2>Native language</h2>
  <h2>Special education</h2>
  <h2>Enrolment, transfers, retirements and admission</h2>
  <p>When the October submission period is opened, the &#39;Enrolment, Transfers, Retirements and Admissions&#39; section on the OnSIS website will be pre-populated with the enrolment at the end of the previous year.  This number cannot be changed as it represents the elementary enrolment on October 31 of the previous year).  The batch file is sending the transfers, retirements and admissions since November 1 last year until October 31 of this year.  Last year&#39;s number, minus the transfers and retirements, plus the admissions, will mathematically determine the enrolment on October 31 of this year. E.g. Enrolment October 31 last year - transfers - retirements + admissions = enrolment October 31 this year.    </p>
