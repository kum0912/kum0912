<h1>Summer school</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
 <p>The Summer school option provides Ontario 
 summer schools and boards with the ability to generate the official Summer 
 School Register. This register option is available to Ontario boards and 
 schools set up with ‘school operating type’ of summer school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a classroom-based register used to record enrolment and attendance 
 for pupils enrolled in the following summer school courses or programs:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Credit courses delivered through classroom instruction</li>
	<li>Credit courses delivered through cooperative education</li>
	<li>Additional preparation for changing course types</li>
	<li>Mathematics courses for changing course types</li>
	<li>Credit recovery</li>
	<li>Non-credit summer school programs for pupils with developmental 
	 disabilities</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Summer school classes or courses:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>May not begin until after the last school day in the school year, 
	 nor may they extend beyond the first school day of the following school 
	 year</li>
	<li>Must be provided by the board between 8 AM and 5 PM</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>This register is for classroom instruction and cannot be used for pupils 
 who are taking correspondence/self-study/e-learning courses through Continuing 
 Education or summer day camps, sports camps, or daycare activies (with 
 the exception of non-credit summer school programs for pupils with developmental 
 disabilities).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This register is used to record enrolment and attendance only for pupils:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Who were enrolled in a day school program during the school year 
	 offered by a board and has been admitted to a summer school program.</li>
	<li>Who were enrolled in grades 1 to 12 in a private school and has 
	 been admitted to a Ministry-funded summer school program offered by 
	 a board.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Schools and boards should be familiar with the official Ministry enrolment 
 register instructions for continuing education programs. These instructions 
 are updated annually on the Ministry’s site <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html">http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html</a>. 
 This includes detailed information on which courses to include on this 
 register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please be familiar with the <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a> option in the student’s record. This 
 will provide detailed information on the enrolment register(s) the student 
 will appear on, as well as high credit and regular FTE/ADE info. Hint: 
 on the FTE and/or ADE card in the student’s record, there’s a Details 
 section that may be expanded to show info on how FTE/ADE is calculated, 
 and how the student’s data impacts the register. Summer school classes 
 are reported as ADE.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Set all students Con. Ed. Student Type to ‘also attends day school’.</h3>
<p>As part of the summer school setup, the <a href="../setup/setup-school-configuration.htm">school’s 
 configuration</a> can set a default Con. Ed. Student Type for students 
 in the school.  This would typically be set to default the Con. Ed. 
 Student Type of ‘Also Attends Day School (Full-time)”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This report will only pick up students with the Con. Ed. Student Type 
 set to:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Full-Time)</li>
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Part-Time)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Continuing education (CE) pupils will not appear on this register. Occasionally, 
 a board will allow a CE student to register in a credit course at a summer 
 school. These students should be in a separate class that will appear 
 on the <a href="on-ereg-con-ed-.htm">Register of Enrolment in Continuing 
 Education Credit Courses</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Set up classes that need to appear on the Summer School Register</h3>
<p>If a class is to appear in the Summer School Register, it must be set 
 up (Setup &gt; Class info &gt; Classes) as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>In the summer school, the course offering type must be set to one 
	 of the following:</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Summer credit course</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Summer: Transfer credit in math</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Summer: Additional preparation for changing 
 course types</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Program for developmentally disabled pupils*</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Enter the most appropriate Delivery and Course delivery type</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <br/>
<img src="assets/images/on-ereg-summer1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:576px;" border="0"/><br/>
</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Since funding is based on attendance, make sure that the class 
	 schedule, start and end dates, and period times are accurate. Make 
	 sure each student’s add/drop dates are accurate (add date is the first 
	 day attending the class, drop date is the first date of non-attendance 
	 in the class).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>* If the course offering type is ‘program for developmentally disabled 
 pupils’, the course code will appear as DD on the summary page of the 
 register, rather than the course code defined for the class.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Teachers track classroom attendance</h3>
<p>Teachers are responsible for taking accurate classroom attendance, just 
 like any regular class.  The class schedule, start/end dates, and 
 the school’s calendar will define what dates the teacher is expected to 
 take attendance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Cancelled instructional sessions – Funded cancelled session “C”</h3>
<p>Where an instructional session has been cancelled owing to exceptional 
 circumstances (such as bad weather or an emergency) and the instructor 
 is paid, the session will be recognized for funding purposes. These sessions 
 are included in the total number of sessions recognized for funding. The 
 funded cancelled session must be marked with a “C” on the register and 
 the reason for the cancellation must be recorded. To cancel a funded session, 
 follow these instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Use Attendance &gt; Enter attendance &gt; Group Excursion.  Select 
	 the date and group of students (e.g. all students or a specific class).</li>
	<li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, 
	 scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select 
	 the option select the option c Cancelled.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-summer2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:522px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Record an attendance note describing the reason for the cancellation.</li>
	<li>Apply (save) the attendance for the group.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: If the “C” session is rescheduled, 
 the instructor should not be paid for the rescheduled session and the 
 rescheduled session must not be included in the total number of sessions 
 recognized for funding purposes. See Rescheduled instructional sessions.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Cancelled instructional sessions – Unfunded cancelled session “D”</h3>
<p>Where an instructional session has been cancelled (I.e. the teacher 
 is unavailable) and the instructor is not paid, the session will not be 
 recognized for funding purposes. Do not include this session in the total 
 number of sessions recognized for funding. The unfunded cancelled session 
 must be marked with a “D” on the register and the reason for the cancellation 
 must be recorded. To cancel an unfunded session, follow these instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Use Attendance &gt; Enter attendance &gt; Group Excursion.  Select 
	 the date and group of students (e.g. a specific class).</li>
	<li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, 
	 scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select 
	 the option select the option $ Cancelled Not Funded.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;"><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-summer3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:518px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: If the “D” session is rescheduled, 
 the instructor should be paid for the rescheduled session and the rescheduled 
 session must be included in the total number of sessions recognized for 
 funding purposes.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Rescheduled sessions  </h3>
<p>If a new session is to be added to the class, typically the class end 
 date is extended to accommodate the extra session. This is done using 
 <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Setup &gt; Class info &gt; 
 Classes</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the rescheduled session is due to a session that is given the code 
 “C” (funded cancelled session), the instructor should not be paid for 
 the rescheduled session and the rescheduled session must not be included 
 in the total number of sessions recognized for funding purposes. To reschedule 
 a session, and have it not appear in the register, follow these instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Use <a href="../attendance/att-enter-groupex.htm">Attendance &gt; 
	 Enter attendance &gt; Group/excursion</a>.  Select the date and 
	 group of students (e.g. All students or a specific class).</li>
	<li>When selecting the attendance code to be applied to the students, 
	 scroll down to the bottom of the list of attendance codes and select 
	 the option select the option ^ Non-instructional Day<br/>
	<br/>
	<img src="assets/images/on-ereg-summer4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:529px;" border="0"/><br/>
	</li>
	<li>Record an attendance note describing the reason the class is removed 
	 from the register (e.g. rescheduled session for the mm/yyyy funded 
	 cancelled session due to weather).</li>
	<li>Apply (save) the attendance for the group.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Generate the Summer School Register</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>To access the register, select Ontario reporting &gt; Enrolment registers 
 &gt; Summer school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-summer-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:202px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The form will look like this:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-summer-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:725px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The list of classes will default any classes that are set up to appear 
 on this register. You may limit the classes using the filters, or select 
 an individual or range of classes to print.  A separate register 
 is generated for each selected class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the Print button located at the bottom of the form. Once the 
 report has been submitted to the task queue, you may leave this application 
 or generate other reports. You will receive notification when your report 
 is ready. Reports are saved in <a href="../setup/setup-file-manager.htm">file 
 manager</a> under Provincial &gt; Enrolment registers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hint: See previously created registers by selecting the folder icon 
 to open file manager at this location.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The info generated on the register may also be exported in a CSV file 
 by checking the option shown below. The CSV file will be generated along 
 with the register report, as part of the submission to the task queue. 
   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-course-grant-export.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:280px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example of the register report:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/on-ereg-summer-report.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:965px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The top of the report will include the register name, school year, class 
 (course code &amp; section letter and course title).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-summer-reporttop.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:556px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each pupil in the class, it will include the following info from 
 the student’s record (in the Personal area):</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Day school pupil’ column is populated with either FT (full-time), 
 PT (part-time) based on the student’s field called ‘Con. Ed. Student Type’ 
 (in student record under <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a>). This report will only pick up students 
 with the Con. Ed. Student Type set to:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Full-Time)</li>
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Part-Time)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>However, if the course delivery type is ‘Program for developmentally 
 disabled pupils’, the summer school is an elementary school, the student 
 is included regardless of the Con. Ed. Student Type.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Residence Status’ column will show either POB (Pupil of the Board) 
 or OP (Other Pupil). A student is considered an Other Pupil (OP) if their 
 student board residence status does not use ministry code 01, 06, 07, 
 or 09.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Day School Address’ column will use the summer student’s origin 
 school as recorded in the student’s record in <a href="../students/enrolment-students.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Student enrolment</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To the right of the student info it will show the student’s attendance 
 at sessions. This info is based on the entry of attendance by the teachers. 
 The dates are based on the setup of the class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-summer-report2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:794px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each date, a blank will appear if the student is present.  If 
 the student was not present at the session, one of the following 4 codes 
 will appear:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A      Pupil absence from a session</p>
<p>—     Late admission or early withdrawal (based 
 on the student’s class add/drop dates)</p>
<p>C       Funded cancelled session</p>
<p>D       Unfunded cancelled session</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each student’s total funded attendance sessions are summed in the far-right 
 column.</p>
<p>   </p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/on-ereg-summer-report3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:92px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a student is an “Other Pupil”, their sessions will not be recognized 
 for funding (their sessions are not summed). For pupils of the board, 
 the funded session sum will include all sessions where the student was 
 present (blank), Absent (A) *, or C (funded cancelled session).   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>* if the student is absent 3 or more consecutive sessions, these absences 
 are not funded (they are excluded from total). Cancelled sessions (“C” 
 or “D”) do not ‘break’ the consecutive absent count.  For example, 
 if a student had 5 consecutive absences in a row (July 4, 5, 6, 7, 10), 
 a cancelled class on July 8 does not count as a consecutive absence, but 
 it also does not break the count of consecutive absences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The sessions recognized for funding will be summed for all students 
 in the class, at the bottom of the register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-summer-report4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:253px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the student details page, a summary page is included with an area 
 for the principal to certify the register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-summer-report5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:720px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Hours per session’ is based on the daily average minutes of instruction 
 set up for the class (using Setup &gt; Class info &gt; Classes). This 
 may be based on period times, or it may be manually entered directly into 
 the daily average minutes of instruction field. The minutes will be converted 
 to hours on this register.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Funding - OnSIS reporting of classes on the Continuing Education Registers</h3>
<p>Funding is based on the information submitted to OnSIS.  See <a href="on-onsis-summer-school-info.htm">OnSIS &gt; Summer school &gt; 
 Summer school info</a> for details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">From the Ministry’s instructions:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Elemental data is collected once a 
 year on August 31 (July-August). Submit data through the Summer School 
 submissions (School Special Condition Type “8 – Summer”).</span>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course Offering Type to be reported for each course for each student. 
 Course Offering Types include:  </p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Summer credit course  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Summer: Transfer credit on math 
	  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Summer: Additional preparation for 
	 changing course types  </p></li>
	<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Elementary Program for pupils 
	 with developmental disabilities</span>  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The following Class Enrolment fields are mandatory:  </p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Course Schedule Indicator  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Course Delivery  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Course Language of Instruction  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Course Code  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Course Start Date  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Course End Date  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Attempted Credit Value  </p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Earned Credit Value  </p></li>
	<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Final Mark</span>  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">The corresponding ADE value must also be 
 reported for each course in the “ADE – Summer” field.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ADE calculations for classes on the Summer School registers</h3>
<p>The calculation of the average daily enrolment (ADE) is calculated as 
 follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ADE = # of sessions recognized for funding 
 x hours per session / 950  </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<h3>Other reports</h3>
<p>The board may want to run this option to check students’ continuing 
 education student type is set correctly for those students also enrolled 
 in day school:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">(from the board) <a href="on-coned-coned-stu-type.htm">Ontario 
 reporting &gt; Continuing education &gt; Continuing education student 
 type</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Continuing education schools may also want to consider running these 
 options:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="on-coned-coned-ade.htm">Ontario 
 reporting &gt; Continuing education &gt; Continuing education ADE</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This generates the OnSIS continuing education enrolment detail and summary 
 report showing average daily enrolment (ADE) info for continuing education 
 or summer school students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="on-ereg-course-list-grant.htm">Ontario 
 reporting &gt; Enrolment registers &gt; Course lists for grant purposes</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This generates class by class details of each register, showing total 
 ADE by register and for the school/board.</p>
