  <h2><a id="Overview"></a> Overview</h2>
  <p>The Completed courses option in a student’s record is an area where you can see all the courses that the student has complete while attending school. Based on provincial requirements, both successful and unsuccessful completed courses can be recorded here, as well as course withdrawals required by some provinces. Although most schools only record courses that the student took as part of their high school program, it can also record courses that are non-credit courses, such as courses taken before high school.<br />
    <br />
    After final report cards are issued, the school runs a process to automatically add the newly completed courses into this area, and therefore, the manual addition of information is typically not required. See Achievement &gt; Marks &amp; comments &gt; Add completed courses for more info on this process.<br />
    <br />
    The student’s completed courses are used to create the student’s transcript. Printing the transcript provides the ability to exclude non-official courses. A student&#39;s transcript may be printed using the Print floating action button located in the lower right corner of this page. Printing transcripts for many student is available using <a href="stu-reports-comp-transcript.htm">Student reports &gt; Completed courses &gt; School transcripts</a>.
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The student&#39;s completed courses are also used to determine whether a student has met their compulsory credit requirements for graduation (see the <a href="achievement-grad-reqmts.htm">Achievement &gt; Graduation requirements</a> option in the student&#39;s record for more info on this). These requirements rely upon the category info and earned credits for each completed course. Sometimes, the category info for the course needs to be slightly different for a student (e.g. substitutions or out of province equivalent credits). When a student&#39;s completed course is edited, you may use the SUB./EQUIVALENCY CREDITS tab to set define different category info affecting just this student.  See <a href="#Substitutions___equivalency_credits">Substitutions &amp; equivalency credits</a> for more info on this feature.<br />
    <br />
    This Completed courses option is available for current, past and future students, however, this option does not exist in elementary schools. Only the school that is the edsembli record owner can edit the student’s completed course information.<br />
    <br />
    The Completed courses option is located in the Achievement sub menu of the student&#39;s record.<br />

  <h2><a name="Completed_courses" id="Completed_courses"></a> Completed courses</h2>
  <p>The Completed courses card will contain the student’s completed courses. As each province may have slight variations in the information that is retained for each course, use the appropriate link below that corresponds to your province for detailed descriptions of each field:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />
    Alberta</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="achievement-completed-courses-bc.htm">British Columbia</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Ontario</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="achievement-completed-courses-mb.htm">Manitoba</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="achievement-completed-courses-nwt.htm">Nunavut</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="achievement-completed-courses-sk.htm">Saskatchewan</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="achievement-completed-courses-stlucia.htm">St. Lucia</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">The information below applies to all provinces, so please be sure to refer to the link for your specific province as well.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">When viewing the completed courses in the table view, it may be necessary to scroll to the right to see all the fields in the table. With tables, you may sort by different columns by selecting the column title to sort by that column, and if necessary, select the column title again to reverse the sort order.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-comp-courses1-1.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 889px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Clicking on a course gives you a menu where you can select <a href="#Details">Details</a> or <a href="#Editing_a_course">Edit</a>.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Although the contents of the card may differ, here are some common features:</p>
  <h3><a id="Adding_a_new_course"></a> Adding a new course</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">The fastest way to manually add a new course is to select the Add icon from the tool bar, and then enter the fields as noted for each province. This add process is typically only needed when a new student enters the board/division/district and their course history must be created by adding each course one at a time.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">The board/division/district controls the allowable courses that may be added, and for each course code, the provincial course number (if applicable), grade level and course title are all part of the definition and may not be changed. All other course specific fields will be defaulted based on the board/division/district definition, however they may be modified as needed to reflect the student’s circumstances.</p>
  <h3><a name="Details" id="Details"></a> Details</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-comp-courses1-2.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 438px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3><a name="Editing_a_course" id="Editing_a_course"></a> Editing a course</h3>
  <p>The fastest way to edit a course is to select the course from the list of completed courses; you can also click the Edit icon to see the same interface. As shown below, selecting the course from the list of completed courses presents more actions such as Details (a view only presentation of the course information) or Edit (to make changes to the course):</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-comp-courses2.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:144px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Selecting Edit will allow you to edit that course as shown here.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-comp-courses3.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:714px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <h3><a id="Removing_a_course"></a> Removing a course</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">To access the Discard icon, edit the course to be removed. From the Edit interface, use the Discard icon (trash can) to discard the data. A confirmation dialogue will always appear for delete actions.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-comp-courses4.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 830px;" /> </p>
  <h3><a id="Substitutions___equivalency_credits"></a> Substitutions &amp; equivalency credits</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Sometimes, the categorization of a course needs to be modified for a student. For example, if a student is not able to complete a physical education credit requirement, where allowed, another course may be used a substitute (e.g. an arts course). The arts course may be edited for this student only so that it is categorized as a physical education course instead of an arts course.  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Sometimes, when a student comes from another province, all earned credits are added as a single course worth multiple credits. In order to take advantage of edsembli SIS&#39;s graduation requirements features, the school may want to determine how those credits are counted toward the student&#39;s required credits for graduation.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Both of these scenarios are possible through the use of the SUB./EQUIVALENCY CREDITS tab, available both when adding and editing a student&#39;s completed course. The changes made in this tab impact only this student.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-comp-courses-subequiv1.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:659px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 1</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Here is an example of an arts course where the credit earned is changed to a physical education category group. It will be treated as if it is a physical education course in the same grade level. To do this, navigate to the SUB./EQUIVALENCY CREDITS tab. Check the box &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Compulsory credit substitution</span>&quot; then change from Art to Physical education in the Category field. Then select the SAVE button in the bottom bar (not shown here).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-comp-courses-subequiv2.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:678px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">There may be the very rare situation where the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Automatically determined</span> box is unchecked. Normally it is checked so that the course can move between category groups, if needed, as additional courses are completed by the student. In the above example, the course will be treated as a physical education course which may be used to fulfil any category groups needing this grade course in physical education. If there is an extraordinary situation where you need to force the credits earned to apply to a specific category group, uncheck the Automatically determined box and then pick the group from the list of all groups that apply to this student&#39;s graduation requirements. Only the groups with the category are available in the Main category group field. This feature is available for any course (e.g. course does not need to be a compulsory credit substitution).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-comp-courses-subequiv4.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:598px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold;">Example 2:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">Here is an example of a course where the student has earned 8 credits in grade 9 courses and only 5 of the credits may be considered as potential compulsory credits. The 3 remaining credits will be counted as other credits (e.g. optional credits).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">To do this, Navigate to the SUB./EQUIVALENCY CREDITS tab, and check the box &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Different values required than defaults in codes table</span>&quot;. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">total credits</span> will be based on the credits earned for the course. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Total credits applied</span> will be automatically updated as credits are entered in the grid. Total credits applied must be equal or less than the Total credits before the SAVE button is enabled.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">In this example, the 1 entered into the &#39;Art row / grade 9 column&#39; represents 1 grade 9 art credit.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/ach-comp-courses-subequiv3.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1113px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">The above approach may be used for regular substitutions as well, but typically it is used when there are multiple credits in different categories or if the substitution involves different grade levels (e.g. student completes a grade 12 English course and it is to be counted as a grade 11 English course).</p>
