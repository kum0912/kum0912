<h1><a name="Classes_overview" id="Classes_overview"></a>Overview - Classes</h1>
<p>After the students’ course selections are entered, the school can begin 
 the process of determining how many classes are needed for each course. 
 A class is required each time a course is taught to a unique group of 
 students. Each class is uniquely identified by a section letter, a lower 
 case ‘a’ to ‘z’ letter, that appears after the course code. For example, 
 MAT10a, MAT10b, MAT10c would represent 3 classes for the same MAT10 course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each class has a number of fields that provide detailed information 
 specific to that class. The most common class fields include the teacher 
 of the class, the room in which it is taught, the schedule (when it is 
 taught), the number of seats in the class (so that you don’t overload 
 the class), and the credits a student will earn upon successful completion 
 of the class.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Depending upon the school, the teacher and the room may be best left 
 unassigned if there are numerous teachers and rooms that can be assigned 
 to the class after it is placed in the timetable.  If there is little 
 to no flexibility with the teacher and/or room, then that information 
 should be entered so that the class is scheduled where both the teacher 
 and room are not already occupied by another class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The class schedule (semester/term and/or day/period patterns) may be 
 entered for a class if there is no flexibility with respect to when it 
 must be taught. Semester/term and/or day/periods may be locked so that 
 any automatic scheduling tools will not change them patterns. For example, 
 you may lock a class into semester 1 but leave day/period unlocked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If there is flexibility, we would suggest that the class schedule only 
 contain the ‘set’ information so that the scheduling tools will find the 
 best placement for the class in the school’s timetable.  For example, 
 ‘set’ information will let the tools know whether the class requires a 
 single semester or a single term or full year (as examples of semester/term 
 sets), and whether the class requires a single period or a double period 
 or every other day (as examples of day/period sets).  The scheduling 
 tools will then schedule the class into the best ‘pattern’ based on the 
 set (e.g. sem 1 or sem 2 pattern, and period 1 or period 2 pattern).  Sets 
 and patterns are user-definable to match the needs of the school. For 
 more information on sets and patterns, see <a href="../setup/setup-class-sem-term-day-pd.htm">Semesters/terms/days/periods</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The tools to create and analyze the classes for next year are as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Class analysis</span>:  Use 
	 <a href="sched-class-analysis.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Classes 
	 &gt; Class analysis</a> to quickly add or remove classes from the 
	 school’s list of classes (master timetable).  By providing information 
	 about the number of students requesting the course vs the number of 
	 seats available (based on the classes already setup), the difference 
	 between requests and seats is presented. This tool also provides the 
	 ability to completely remove all classes if you want to build the 
	 classes table starting with no classes.<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Classes</span>:  The list 
	 of classes next year, aka the school&#39;s master timetable, is found 
	 using <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Scheduling next year 
	 &gt; Classes &gt; Classes</a>. Classes can be added, removed, 
	 and edited from here.  <br/>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Teacher master timetable</span><span>:</span> 
	  Use <a href="sched-teacher-master-timetable.htm">Scheduling 
	 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Teacher master timetable</a> to see a 
	 concise list of teachers and the classes they teach during a specific 
	 semester/term.  <br/>
	</li>
	<li style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Room master 
	 timetable</span><span>:  Use <a href="sched-room-master-timetable.htm">Scheduling 
	 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Room master timetable</a> to see a concise 
	 list of rooms and the classes taught in each room during a specific 
	 semester/term.  .<br/>
	</span></li>
	<li style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Snapshots</span><span>: 
	  Next year’s classes (aka the school’s master schedule) can be 
	 saved at any point in the scheduling process using <a href="shed-snapshots.htm">Scheduling 
	 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Snapshots</a>.  As you work toward 
	 the final master timetable, you may want to try different scenarios 
	 knowing that you can restore a snapshot anytime. <br/>
	</span></li>
	<li style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reset 
	 class schedules</span><span>:  Use <a href="sched-reset-class-schedules.htm">Scheduling 
	 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Reset class schedules</a> to remove the 
	 patterns assigned to classes, leaving only the set information in 
	 the class schedule.  With the patterns removed, the scheduling 
	 tools may be used to reschedule the classes into the best location 
	 in the timetable.  Patterns may be removed from classes where 
	 this information is unlocked (recommended) or locked (not recommended 
	 unless the locking was used incorrectly).  While resetting the 
	 pattern information, the tool can also remove the teacher and room 
	 assigned to the class.  <br/>
	<br/>
	Note:  resetting class schedules is typically used if you want 
	 to start the scheduling of classes all over again and take a different 
	 approach.<br/>
	</span></li>
	<li style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rooms</span><span>: 
	  Every class is taught in a specific room, and the room must 
	 be listed in the table of next year’s rooms. It may be edited without 
	 impacting this year’s list of rooms using <a href="../setup/setup-class-rm-printrm-tt.htm">Scheduling 
	 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Rooms</a>.</span></li>
