<h1>Correspondence/self-study/e-learning</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<p>The Correspondence/self-study/e-learning option provides Ontario schools 
 and boards with the ability to generate the official Register of Enrolment 
 in Correspondence/self-Study/e-Learning Courses. This register option 
 is available to Ontario boards and schools set up with ‘school operating 
 type’ of continuing education. Occasionally, a board will allow a CE student 
 to register in a correspondence/self-study/e-learning course at a summer 
 school. Therefore, this option is also available for summer schools so 
 that these CE students can print on this register rather than the Summer 
 School Register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This register records data on pupil’s lessons/work units marked (not 
 attendance) only for pupils enrolled in the following courses:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Correspondence courses offered using materials provided by the 
	 ILC  </li>
	<li>Correspondence or self-study courses prepared by the board  </li>
	<li>E-learning courses prepared by the board  </li>
	<li>E-learning offered through the provincial LMS</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The courses must be provided:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>During the school year,  </li>
	<li>In the summer, or  </li>
	<li>From September to August</li>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<p>This register may include pupils exclusively enrolled in CE, part-time 
 day pupils. Full-time day pupils taking CE correspondence/self-study/e-learning 
 courses will appear on the register, however their lessons/work units 
 marked will not be funded unless the course was taken in the summer period. 
 If the full-time day pupil is to receive this funding as well, set the 
 student’s Con. Ed. Student Type to ‘Also attends day school’.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Schools and boards should be familiar with the official Ministry enrolment 
 register instructions for continuing education programs. These instructions 
 are updated annually on the Ministry’s site <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html">http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html</a>. 
 This includes detailed information on which courses to include on this 
 register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please be familiar with the <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a> option in the student’s record. This 
 will provide detailed information on the enrolment register(s) the student 
 will appear on, as well as high credit and regular FTE/ADE info. Hint: 
 on the FTE and/or ADE card in the student’s record, there’s a Details 
 section that may be expanded to show info on how FTE/ADE is calculated, 
 and how the student’s data impacts the register. Correspondence, self-study 
 &amp; e-learning classes are reported as ADE.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>References to ‘lessons’ refers to ‘lessons/work units’.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Set up classes that need to appear on the Register of Correspondence/Self-Study/e-Learning 
 Courses</h2>
<p>If a class is to appear in the Correspondence/Self-Study/e-Learning 
 register, it must be set up (<a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Setup 
 &gt; Class info &gt; Classes</a>) as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The course offering type must be set to one of the following:</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Independent Learning Centre (ILC) course</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- Correspondence course</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">- e-Learning course *</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Enter the most appropriate Delivery and Course delivery type (* 
	 e-learning must have a summer delivery in order to appear on this 
	 register).<br/>
	<img src="assets/images/on-ereg-corr-self-study1A.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:721px;" border="0"/><br/>
	</li>
	<li>Record the number of lessons that teachers must mark. This number 
	 is not to exceed 20 per credit.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>If the class has start and end dates, record those dates, otherwise 
	 the class may be flagged as continuous entry (runs all year and each 
	 student can start and finish the course at their pace).</li>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<h3>Teachers track marked lessons/work units</h3>
<p>Since funding allocation is based on the number of lessons/work units 
 marked, rather than attendance, the teacher will need to track the marked 
 lessons/work units by entering a ‘mark’ when it is marked (does not need 
 to be successfully completed to be recognized for grant purposes). Any 
 mark other than zero will be considered a marked lesson/work unit on the 
 register.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The teacher will have a markbook category called ‘Lessons Marked’, with 
 markbook items L1, L2 … up to the # of lessons set up for the class.  This 
 is an example of what the teacher will see:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-corr-self-study1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:479px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Teachers may want to change the titles from Lesson 1, etc, to a title 
 that reflects the course material in the unit.  Since students may 
 complete units at different times or different orders, the date the mark 
 was entered is automatically recorded and will appear beside the mark 
 as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-corr-self-study2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:92px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The teacher may select this date and change it.  Teachers should 
 be making sure this date accurately represent the student’s lesson date. 
  For students who received full-time funding on the October and/or 
 March count date, the student’s lesson date is used to determine whether 
 the lesson is included (funded) on the register.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Generate the Register of Enrolment in Correspondence/Self-Study/e-Learning 
 Courses</h2>
<p>To access the register, select Ontario reporting &gt; Enrolment registers 
 &gt; Correspondence/self-study/e-learning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The form will look like this:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-corr-self-study3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:719px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The list of classes will default any classes that are set up to appear 
 on this register. You may limit the classes using the filters, or select 
 an individual or range of classes to print.  A separate register 
 is generated for each selected class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the Print button located at the bottom of the form. Once the 
 report has been submitted to the task queue, you may leave this application 
 or generate other reports. You will receive notification when your report 
 is ready. Reports are saved in <a href="../setup/setup-file-manager.htm">file 
 manager</a> under Provincial &gt; Enrolment registers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hint: See previously created registers by selecting the folder icon 
 to open file manager at this location.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The info generated on the register may also be exported in a CSV file 
 by checking the option shown below. The CSV file will be generated along 
 with the register report, as part of the submission to the task queue. 
   </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/on-ereg-course-grant-export.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:280px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example of the register report:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-corr-self-study-report1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:794px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The top of the report will include the register name, school year, class 
 (course code &amp; section letter and course title).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-corr-self-study-reporttop.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:598px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each pupil in the class, it will include the following info from 
 the student’s record (in the Personal area):</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-corr-self-study-report2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:714px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Category of pupil’ column is populated based on the student’s field 
 called ‘Con. Ed. Student type’ (in student record under <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a>).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>FT (full-time) appears if the student’s Con. Ed. Student Type is one 
 of the following types:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Full-time)</li>
	<li>Full-Time Day School (exclude from Register totals)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>PT (part-time) appears if the student’s Con. Ed. Student Type is one 
 of the following types:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Part-time)</li>
	<li>Part-time taking same course(s) in day school (exclude from register 
	 totals).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>CE (continuing education) appears if the student’s Con. Ed. Student 
 Type is:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Only Attends Con. Ed. School</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The ‘Other Pupils OP’ column will show OP (Other Pupil) if the student 
 is considered an Other Pupil (OP). OP will appear if the board defined 
 student board residence status does not use ministry code 01, 06, 07, 
 or 09.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To the right of the student info it will show the student’s lessons 
 marked.  This info is based on the entry of lessons marked the teachers. 
 The lessons are based on count, not order so that if a student completed 
 lessons 1, 3, 8 and 10, the check mark would appear under lessons 1, 2, 
 3 and 4.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-corr-self-study5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:522px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each lesson, a check mark will appear if the lesson has been marked. 
  The number of lessons is based upon the setup of the class.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each student’s total number of lessons marked are summed in the far-right 
 columns (under either ‘Sept – June’ or ‘Summer’).  The student’s 
 class add/drop dates determine whether all of the student’s lessons count 
 in the Sept-June or Summer column (cannot appear in both columns).  If 
 the student enrolls in the class prior to July 1 or completes the class 
 after August 31, all sessions appear in the Sept-June column. If the student 
 enrolls in the class on July 1 or later or completes the class prior to 
 August 31, all sessions appear in the Summer column.  If the delivery 
 = summer, and type of course = e-learning, then all totals will appear 
 in the summer column.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-corr-self-study6.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:115px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The lessons marked is totaled for all students in the class, at the 
 bottom of the register.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-corr-self-study7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:290px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the student details page, a summary page is included with an area 
 for the principal to certify the register.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On this page, the lessons for full-time day school pupils are subtracted 
 from the total number of lessons marked (see below for more info).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-corr-self-study-report.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:668px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the summary page, the ‘Type of Course (check one)’ field is populated 
 based on the setup of the class field ‘Course offering type’:</p>
<p> </p>
<table style="vertical-align: top; border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" cellspacing="0" width="100%" border="1">
	<colgroup><col style="width: 50%;"/>
	<col style="width: 50%;"/>
	</colgroup><tbody><tr>
		<td bgcolor="#C0C0C0">Type of Course check box on summary page</td>
		<td bgcolor="#C0C0C0"><p>Course offering type set up for class</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>Course purchased from the Independent Learning Centre (ILC)</p></td>
		<td>Independent Learning Centre (ILC) course</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>Correspondence course prepared by the board</p></td>
		<td><p>Correspondence course</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>e-Learning course</td>
		<td><p>e-Learning course</p></td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Lessons eligible for funding</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All lessons on the class list details page are not necessarily eligible 
 for funding.  Some lessons may be subtracted as recorded in the “Subtract: 
 lessons for full-time day school pupils” field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-corr-self-study-report3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:363px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lessons are recognized for funding if the student’s Con. Ed. Student 
 Type is:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Only Attends Con. Ed. School</li>
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Full-time)  </li>
	<li>Also Attends Day School (Part-time)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If a student is an “Other Pupil”, their lessons will not be recognized 
 for funding (their lessons are subtracted in the ‘lessons for full-time 
 pupils’ section).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some students are not eligible for funding and their lessons taught 
 between September 1 and June 30 must be subtracted.  When a student’s 
 Con. Ed Type is one of the following, their lessons are subtracted:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Full-Time Day School (exclude from register totals)</li>
	<li>Part-time taking same course(s) in day school (exclude from register 
	 totals).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>All lessons are funded for pupils of the board if they are between July 
 1 and August 31 (based on the date each student’s lesson was marked), 
 regardless of the student’s Con. Ed. Type.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since students may change Con. Ed. Types throughout the school year, 
 depending upon the date of the student&#39;s Con. Ed. Student Type change 
 (as recorded in the student’s <a href="../students/enrolment-internal-transfers.htm">internal 
 transfers</a>), some lessons may be counted. Using an example of a student 
 who changes from Only Attends Con. Ed. School (which is funded on this 
 CE register) to Full-time Day school (which is not funded on this CE register), 
 the date of the change will impact the sessions counted as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Internal transfer date is prior to 10/31:  it will exclude 
	 all lessons (because the student received FT funding on the OnSIS 
	 count Oct 31/Mar 31 dates).</li>
	<li>Internal transfer date is after 10/31 and before March 31: it will 
	 count all lessons between Sept 1 and Jan 31 (and then the student 
	 will receive FT funding on the OnSIS Mar 31 count date).</li>
	<li>Internal transfer date is after March 31 date: it will count all 
	 lessons (the student does not get FT funding for either Oct or March, 
	 but receives the CE funding instead).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Funding - OnSIS reporting of classes on the Continuing Education Registers</h3>
<p>Funding is based on the information submitted to OnSIS.  See <a href="on-onsis-coned-night-school.htm">OnSIS &gt; Night/continuing 
 education school &gt; ConEd/Night school info</a> for details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the Ministry’s instructions:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Elemental data is collected once a 
 year on August 31 for the entire school year (September-August). Submit 
 data through the Continuing Education and/or Summer School submissions 
 (School Special Condition Type “N – Continuing Education” or “8 – Summer”).</span> 
  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course Offering Type must be reported for each course for each student. 
 Course Offering Types include:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Independent Learning Centre (ILC) 
	 course</p></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;">Correspondence Course</p></li>
	<li><span style="font-style: italic;">E-Learning Course</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following Class Enrolment fields are mandatory:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li> <span style="font-style: italic;">Course Schedule Indicator 
	  </span></li>
	<li><p style="font-style: italic;"> Course Delivery  </p></li>

	<li><p style="font-style: italic;"> Earned Credit Value  </p></li>
	<li><span style="font-style: italic;"> Final Mark</span>  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The corresponding ADE value must also 
 be reported for each course in the “ADE – September to June” or “ADE – 
 Summer” fields.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ADE calculations for classes on the Correspondence/Self-Study/e-Learning 
 Courses registers</h3>
<p>The calculation of the average daily enrolment (ADE) is calculated as 
 follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ADE = # of lessons eligible for funding 
 x 0.00579 (rounded to four decimals)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other reports</h2>
<p>The board may want to run this option to check students’ continuing 
 education student type is set correctly for those students also enrolled 
 in day school:</p>
