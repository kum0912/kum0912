  <h1> Student records &gt; Incidents</h1>
  <hr align="center" style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

  <p>The incidents option provides a way to record detailed information about school incidents where disciplinary action is usually involved. Incidents are school-specific, however, with permissions, you may see the incidents recorded by another school.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A single incident may involve one or many students. Common incident information such as the date, location, and time is entered, and then the students involved in the incident are recorded. Each student involved has independent infraction and consequence information<span style="color:#000000;">.</span> A student may have one or more infractions that are applied by selecting from a list of infractions (possible activities engaged in by a student that would breach the school/board/division’s set of rules such as fighting, bullying, possessing alcohol or illegal drugs, vandalism). Similarly, the student may have one or more consequences (the result of the incident such as detention, suspension, expulsion).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Along with the infraction(s) and consequence(s), many additional fields are available to provide very detailed information on the incident. Many fields select from the table of values so that the information may be analyzed and reported. Before a school can start recording information about student incidents, these tables must be first setup by the board/division/district using the options under the Setup menu (e.g. <a href="../setup/setup-define-infractions.htm">Setup &gt; Incidents &gt; Infractions</a> or <a href="../setup/setup-define-conseq.htm">Setup &gt; Incidents &gt; Consequences</a>).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Incident info may be added/accessed using the Incidents option from the main menu or from the student&#39;s record using the Incidents option. This Incidents option appears for all students, including past students, however new incidents cannot be added for past students.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>When incident info is accessed from a student’s record, you will see only those incidents involving this student at this school.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <p>  </p>
  <p>Use the Add icon to add a new incident involving this student, or select the incident (e.g. row click) to edit an existing incident. If an incident needs to be removed, the Delete icon is available when you edit the incident.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><a href="../incidents/inc-overview.htm">If you are not already familiar with the incident functionality, see the Incidents section of the manual.</a>  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Here are some reminders:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>When you add a new incident, the student will automatically be involved in the incident. Other students involved may be added using the Add icon in the Student(s) involved card.</li>
    <li>Date, location, time, time frame, reported by, and note should be entered about the incident in general (e.g. there is another area for notes and info about each student&#39;s involvement in the incident).</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/stu-incidents3.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 988px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Enter detailed info about each student&#39;s involvement, including infraction and consequence info. To do this, select the student (e.g. row click) on the Student(s) involved card. When an infraction is added for the student, the consequence details will appear.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/stu-incidents4.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 753px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>When entering the student&#39;s details, use the Add icon on the infractions card to add an infraction. Consequences may be defaulted based on the infraction selected, automatically appearing on the consequences card. Select the consequence (row click) to fill in the duration info.</li>
    <li>Multiple infractions and consequences may be added using the Add icons on the respective cards.</li>
    <li>Suspension/expulsion program and appeal/outcome info is optional, but if needed, may be recorded using the Edit icon on these cards.</li>
    <li>Incident numbers are automatically generated.</li>
  </ul>
