<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>Most elementary schools use homerooms to represent a group of students 
 who receive classroom instruction for many subjects from the same teacher. 
 In high schools, homerooms are optional but are still used by many schools. 
 They provide a specific time and classroom where students meet under the 
 supervision of a teacher for the administration of school business (announcements, 
 distribution of notes, etc).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each school has a unique table of homerooms. Each homeroom has a room 
 number, a designation (a meaningful way to identify the homeroom), and 
 the ability to assign  up to 2 teachers.  After set up, each 
 student can be optionally assigned to a homeroom. If homerooms change 
 between semesters, the student’s homeroom is reassigned after the completion 
 of a semester (e.g. the student has only 1 homeroom for the school year).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the initial set up, from year to year, this table may not require 
 changes. This setup area is used under the following circumstances:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Homerooms need to be add/edited to reflect new teachers</li>
	<li>Homerooms need to be add/edited to reflect new and room assignments</li>
	<li>An additional teacher is assigned to the homeroom</li>
	<li>You have been recommended to use class associations to assist in 
	 creating timetables for elementary students.</li>
	<li>You have been asked to review the report card terms/topics assigned 
	 to homerooms.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Student tools area of Maplewood connectEd has options to help schools 
 with the assignment of homerooms to the students. Homerooms must be defined 
 correctly before moving onto the assign features. In most cases, the homerooms 
 are setup first in the table of homerooms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Choose Setup, then Class setup.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>This will take you to the Class setup section where you will find the 
 Homerooms card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/homeroom1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:237px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select either the THIS YEAR or NEXT YEAR button on the card to access 
 the homerooms that are available for the appropriate school year. The 
 homerooms may be different for each of the school years to allow the school 
 to plan for future changes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: The initialize scheduling process 
 automatically copies this year’s homerooms over to next year’s homerooms, 
 while the year-end roll over process (transfer to current) copies next 
 year’s homerooms over to this year’s homerooms.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Homerooms" id="Homerooms"></a>Homerooms</h2>
<p>Here is an example of the list of homerooms. It will be sorted in alphabetic 
 order (numbers first then letters).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/homeroom2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:660px;" border="0"/> 
  </p>
<p>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the search icon to find a specific homeroom, or use the page navigation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each homeroom has the following fields:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Room number</span>: 
  The physical room in which the students in the homeroom meet. The 
 room must first exist in the school’s table of rooms (see <a href="setup-class-rm-printrm-tt.htm#Rooms">Rooms 
 for more information</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Designation</span>: 
 A short code (4 character maximum) to describe the homeroom. Sometimes 
 it is the same as the room number, other times it represents the grade 
 or grades of the students and/or their teacher (e.g. 1A, 2A, 1SM, 3/4 
  for a split 3 &amp;4, 6A, 6B).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Teacher(s</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">)</span>: The teacher who is responsible 
 for the students in the homeroom. Only those staff members with the “Is 
 teacher” field set to Yes may be homeroom teachers. Up to 2 teachers may 
 be assigned to a homeroom at a time.</p>
<p style="font-style: normal;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Early 
 childhood educator(s)</span>: Ontario elementary schools may select the 
 ECEs assigned to this homeroom.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Class 
 type</span>: Ontario elementary schools must select the most appropriate 
 type from the list (Regular, Special education, Intensive Core French, 
 Other).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Achievement 
 profile</span>: There may be some report card set ups that have report 
 card terms and topics assigned to homerooms rather than classes. For those 
 setups, the achievement profile is assigned here. </p>
<h3><a name="Editing_a_homeroom" id="Editing_a_homeroom"></a>Editing a 
 homeroom</h3>
<p>Select the homeroom from the list to access the Edit option.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/homeroom7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:340px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then proceed to change the homeroom information as needed. While editing 
 a room, it is possible to navigate to the next or previous room in the 
 list using the NEXT ROOM and PREVIOUS ROOM buttons at the bottom of page. 
 Selecting these buttons will SAVE the changes and move to the next homeroom.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><img src="assets/images/homeroom4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:499px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: Selecting a homeroom from the list 
 provides access to the Details option as well as the Edit option. The 
 Details option is standard on all tables, and in this case, provides nothing 
 that isn&#39;t already displayed on the list.</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>When a homeroom is edited, all students that are currently assigned 
 to that homeroom will have the edits automatically applied. For example, 
 if homeroom 9SM 101 Ms. Jane Smith were edited to 10SM 102 Ms. Jane Smith, 
 then all the students that were in 9SM 101 would be changed to 10SM 102 
 Ms. Jane Smith.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Adding_a_new_homeroom" id="Adding_a_new_homeroom"></a>Adding 
 a new homeroom</h3>
<p>Use the Add icon in the homerooms tool bar to add a new homeroom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/homeroom5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:570px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Removing_a_homeroom" id="Removing_a_homeroom"></a>Removing 
 a homeroom</h3>
<p>As a safeguard, homerooms may not be removed if they are assigned to 
 any students for the selected school year (this or next year). If a homeroom 
 is to be removed, select the homeroom from the list to access the Edit 
 option. From the edit homeroom tool bar, select the Delete icon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/homeroom9.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:551px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="Assigned_classes"></a>Assigned classes</h3>
<p>The ASSIGNED CLASSES tab is available for elementary schools only. This 
 feature is beneficial when all the students in the homeroom have the same 
 classes in their timetables. Timetables for elementary students are optional, 
 however, most report card setups will use classes to represent the subjects 
 on a report card. This feature allows classes to be associated with a 
 homeroom so that timetables may be automatically created for students 
 as they are assigned to the homeroom. Assigned classes are available for 
 setup for both this year and next year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each homeroom, the grade levels of the students in the homeroom 
 are specified (e .g. a split grade 1/2 homeroom is shown in the example 
 below). For each grade in the homeroom, the potential classes for that 
 grade are displayed and those classes associated with that homeroom are 
 flagged with a check mark (e.g. ART1b, DAN1b in the example below). Hint: 
 Click the header above the check boxes to sort the table by this column.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/homeroom13.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1431px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Group classes that 
 share achievement topics</span> (e.g. achievement profiles):  This 
 option appears if the homeroom has 2 or more grades. Check this box, if 
 the classes that have the same achievement profile are automatically grouped 
 (so they have the same teacher, room, and class schedule). E.g. DAN1b 
 and DAN2b would be grouped if they both have the same achievement profile.  (This 
 might be beneficial to Ontario schools when reporting educator subject 
 assignments to OnSIS).</p>
<h2><a name="Understanding_auto_assign_feature" id="Understanding_auto_assign_feature"></a>Understanding 
 auto assign feature to add classes to timetables of students in homeroom</h2>
<p>For each checked class, pay close attention to the Auto Assign setting 
 (either Yes or No). If the Auto Assign column indicates Yes for the associated 
 class, it will be automatically added to the student’s timetable. If Auto 
 Assign is set to No, the class is associated for reference purposes only 
 but is never automatically added to the timetable. For example, some may 
 choose to define the class associations for all the potential classes 
 that may apply to the students in the homeroom, but only those classes 
 that everyone gets will have the Auto Assign set to Yes. For example, 
 the core subjects might be set to Yes, while students split into optional 
 classes set to No. Use the drop down arrow beside the Yes or No to change 
 this setting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During the homeroom setup, when this homeroom is saved (e.g. selecting 
 DONE or NEXT HOMEROOM or PREVIOUS HOMEROOM), the Auto Assign feature will 
 automatically add any associated classes that are set to Auto Assign. 
 It will only add missing classes not already in the student’s timetable 
 – it will not remove any classes already assigned to the student that 
 are not associated to the homeroom. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE CORRECT SECTION 
 LETTER OF THE COURSES CHECKED OFF FOR THE HOMEROOM otherwise you may end 
 up with duplicate classes in the students’ timetables.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Auto Assign is also used when a student’s homeroom is first specified. 
 All classes for that homeroom/grade are added to the student’s timetable 
 automatically (i.e. only classes set to Yes for Auto Assign are added).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Auto assign is also used when a student’s homeroom is changed. Those 
 classes associated with the student’s original homeroom/grade will be 
 automatically dropped (regardless of whether Auto Assign is Yes or No). 
 Then, the classes associated with the student’s new homeroom/grade are 
 added to the student’s timetable automatically, if the class is set to 
 Yes for Auto Assign. Note: if the student has a class in their timetable 
 that is not associated with the original homeroom, that class will not 
 be dropped.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Report card marks and comments are linked to classes. If a student changes 
 homerooms, it will attempt to move the marks and comments from one class 
 to the corresponding new class that has the same terms and topics. If 
 report card information cannot be moved, it will be retained with the 
 deleted class.</p>
<h3>Important notes before using this feature</h3>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Please follow all steps and read all instructions. This new feature 
	 allows classes to be added to the classes table, and the Auto Assign 
	 feature impacts students’ and teachers’ timetables.</li>
	<li>Schools that have already assigned timetables to students may optionally 
	 follow these steps. This is a powerful feature that will save elementary 
	 schools time in the future, and therefore, we suggest that everyone 
	 consider setting this information up at some point.</li>
	<li style="font-style: italic;">Note: The auto assign feature DOES 
	 NOT consider timetable conflicts when assigning students these classes 
	 automatically. Conflicts exist when more than one class is scheduled 
	 at the same time. If periods are assigned to classes, make sure that 
	 the classes associated with the homeroom do not conflict.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h3>Step 1: Determine whether add/drops are to be recorded</h3>
<p>As classes are added and dropped from a student’s timetable, the dates 
 when the classes were added and/or dropped are automatically recorded. 
 Every class in the student’s timetable must have a corresponding “add” 
 record. These add/drop dates are important for secondary schools but are 
 not as important for elementary schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a student has been in a class since they started school this year, 
 the add date is typically the first day of school. If timetables are being 
 created later in the school year, it is possible to have these dates still 
 default the first day of school for the student. There is a setting that 
 allows the school to set the number of days into the school year before 
 the program records the actual add/drop date (rather than just defaulting 
 the first day of school). Check that the school’s configuration for recording 
 add/drop dates is correct. There are 2 settings to check, and they are 
 both found under <a href="setup-school-configuration.htm">Setup&gt; School 
 &gt; Configuration</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Days before recording timetable 
	 changes</span>  will default 1, which means that the actual date 
	 the student added or dropped the class will be recorded starting after 
	 the first day of school. If there are 200 school days, and 200 is 
	 entered here, the actual date that the student’s timetable was change 
	 will never be recorded (it will always be the student’s start of the 
	 school year). Elementary schools may want to set this to 200. Some 
	 may want to start recording add/drop dates after the first couple 
	 of months of school when they know that timetables are in the process 
	 of being inputted (e.g. 60 days).</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style: lower-roman;">
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Timetable changes apply to all 
	 semesters</span> (only appears if school has 2 or more semesters), 
	 if set to Yes, and the school has multiple semesters, means that timetable 
	 add/drops will not be recorded until after the number of days specified 
	 into the 2nd, or 3rd, etc semester. For example, if a secondary school 
	 has 2 semesters, and 5 days is specified for “Number of Days Before 
	 Recording Timetable Changes”, then semester 2 timetable changes for 
	 the first 5 days in second semester will recorded in the add/drop 
	 area as if the student was in the class from the start of the semester 
	 (adds will be created, drops will be removed). Changes from the 6th 
	 day on will use the actual date to record all class adds and drops.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h3>Step 2: Specify the Grade(s) of the Students in Each Homeroom</h3>
<p>The next step is to specify the grade levels of the students in each 
 homeroom. To do this, edit the homeroom, select the ASSIGNED CLASSES tab, 
 then select the Add Grade button. It will present all the grades used 
 by the school, from which you will select each grade appropriate for the 
 homeroom. With the selected grades checked off, select SAVE.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/homeroom15.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:916px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will notice that a card is created for each of the selected grades.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each Grade’s card will have all of the classes associated with the selected 
 grade (based on the grade field in the courses table). There may be classes 
 listed (if already setup in the classes table) or there may be no classes 
 (if they will be setup as part of the next step).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the example above, the section ‘a’ grade 8 classes are already in 
 the classes table and therefore, they automatically appear. If this list 
 includes the classes to be assigned to this homeroom, follow step 3, option 
 i. If this homeroom’s classes are not listed here, follow step 3, option 
 ii (which would be the situation for this example).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/homeroom16.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:916px;" border="0"/></p>
<h3>Step 3: Select classes associated to the homeroom</h3>
<p>Depending on whether or not the school has already setup classes in 
 the Classes table, there are two approaches to associating classes to 
 the students in the homeroom.</p>
<h4>i. Classes already exist</h4>
<p>Find the class (course code and section letter appropriate for students 
 in this homeroom/grade), and click the box to the left of the class. Hint: 
 use the paging controls to show more records. Change the “Auto Assign” 
 column to Yes or No depending upon whether the class is to be automatically 
 added as described earlier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/homeroom17.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:664px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>ii. Classes do not already exist</h4>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">If the classes for the students in the 
 homeroom/grade do not already exist, use the Add New Section icon in the 
 tool bar of the Grade X – Class associations card. It will present all 
 the courses for that grade level where you can select which courses require 
 class sections to be created. Courses with a check mark will have a new 
 class added to the classes table upon selecting the SAVE button shown 
 below.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><img src="assets/images/homeroom18.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:228px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Classes will be created using the next available section letter and 
 they will be the assigned classes for this homeroom. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The room, teacher, occupancy, auto assign, and language fields may be 
 edited, if required, by selecting the field to be changed. Change 
 the “Auto Assign” column to Yes or No depending upon whether the class 
 is to be automatically added as described earlier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For schools that actually define where classes appear in the timetable, 
 the newly added classes will still require  edits to indicate when 
 the classes are taught (using <a href="setup-class-classes.htm">Setup&gt; 
 Class info &gt; Classes</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: for both option i and ii above, when 
 you select SAVE, if the homeroom has any classes set as Yes to “Auto assign”, 
 a message will briefly appear indicating &#39;Students’ timetables have been 
 checked. Any missing classes have been added.</p>
<p> </p>
