<p>This option is only available to Ontario schools. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Enrolment register info option only applies to Ontario students 
 as it contains information about the student that influences the school’s 
 enrolment registers. The Ontario Ministry has complex reporting requirements 
 around student enrolment as explained in their two annual Ministry publications, 
 and the SIS has extensive details for setting up classes and students 
 each official register. Follow the links in the chart for additional info 
 on the registers. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The info recorded in this area of the student’s record is used when 
 generating official enrolment registers and when reporting the student 
 to OnSIS for funding. To help simplify the data entry, this area will 
 have variations between different students and school types.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Choose Enrolment &gt; Enrolment register info from the submenu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/enrolment-info-menu.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:242px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you select Enrolment register info, the form will show up to 3 
 cards, depending upon the student: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Register info </p>
<p>Full-time equivalent (FTE) </p>
<p>Average daily enrolment (ADE) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Only the first card has fields that may be entered. The other cards 
 show the student’s FTE and ADE calculations for today and the Ministry’s 
 count dates (October 31, March 31, June 30). FTE and ADE values are calculated 
 for regular and high credits.  The cards with these calculations 
 include a details area which may be expanded to show some explanations 
 on how these values are calculated, along with some quick links to other 
 area of the student’s record that may influence these calculations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ontario schools should be familiar with the terms FTE, ADE, and High 
 Credit. The Ministry has different funding formulas for regular FTE, regular 
 ADE, high credit FTE and high credit ADE. The SIS will automatically calculate 
 these values for each student.  A basic explanation of these terms 
 is provided at the end of this page. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 3 cards are explained below. If the student in enrolled in multiple 
 schools in the board this year, select the school that you want from the 
 drop down list: </p>

<h2><a id="Register_info"></a>Register info</h2>
<p>This card is the only card that contains fields that may be edited to 
 reflect the student’s enrolment at this school. Fields will show/hide 
 based on the type of school. It also provides “Notes” that will help the 
 school understand how the ministry’s enrolment registers will treat this 
 student.   </p>

<p>Here is an example of a typical student attending a regular school:</p>

<h2><a id="FTE_ADE_High_Credit_terminology"></a>FTE, ADE, High Credit 
 terminology </h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Ontario schools should be familiar with the terms FTE, ADE, and High 
 Credit. The Ministry has different funding formulas for regular FTE, regular 
 ADE, high credit FTE and high credit ADE. The SIS will automatically calculate 
 these values for each student.  Here is a basic explanation of these 
 terms: </p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">FTE (full-time equivalent)</span>: 
	 For many students attending regular publicly funded schools (e.g. 
	 regular elementary and secondary students), the Ministry funds a student 
	 based on the amount of school instruction the student receives. A 
	 full-time student has 210 minutes or more of classroom instruction 
	 per school day. A full-time student has an FTE of 1.0.  In the 
	 SIS, the student’s attendance type is set to full-time.  </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If a student has less than 210 minutes of 
 classroom instruction per school day, in the SIS, the student’s attendance 
 type is set to part-time.  The SIS will calculate the student’s FTE 
 value, as a proportion of instructional time compared to a full-time student. 
 The calculation is based on the average daily minutes of instruction divided 
 by the average daily total number of minutes of instruction offered with 
 the school. As a simple example, a secondary student taking 2 courses 
 in a semester when full time students take 4 courses, the student would 
 have a 0.50 FTE (e.g. 150 minutes/ 300 minutes offered).  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If a student were taking 3 courses instead, 
 the student would have a 0.75 FTE. If the FTE calculation is equal to 
 or greater than 0.70, the student is considered full-time with an FTE 
 of 1.00. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Since FTE is based on the student’s timetable, 
 as the student’s timetable changes, it is possible that the student’s 
 FTE is affected.   </p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ADE (Average daily enrolment)</span>: 
	  ADE values are calculated for students taking continuing education 
	 and summer school classes and programs.  The individual class/program 
	 ADE calculations are summed for the student. The funding for correspondence/self-study 
	 classes = # of lessons/work units marked x 0.00579. The funding for 
	 all other classes/programs = # of sessions recognized for funding 
	 x hours per session /950. </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">ADE is automatically set to 0.00 if the student 
 is also attending a regular day school full-time, or if the student is 
 part-time taking the same courses in a day school. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">ADE is automatically set to 0.00 if the student 
 is part-time taking the same course(s) in a day school. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Continuing education ADE is not differentiated 
 between regular and high credit ADE. It will all appear as regular ADE. 
 </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">ADE, rather than FTE, is also used for classes 
 that appear on the Independent Study and e-Learning Register (for regular 
 day schools/e-learning schools/CTCC schools). Only these classes can have 
 regular ADE and high credit ADE. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The calculation of average daily enrolment 
 and high credit factors is available in the Education Act, Ontario Regulation 
 286/18. For 2018, see: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/180286#BK15 
 </p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">High credit</span>: Regular FTE 
	 calculations apply to classes where the student’s total credits (earned 
	 + projected credits based on timetable on the count date) are 34 credits 
	 or less. High credit FTE applies to eligible students with over 34 
	 credits. High credit FTE receives different funding than regular FTE. 
	 ESL, ELD, ALF, PANA, and credits earned at private schools are excluded 
	 from the credit count. The following students are exempt from the 
	 high credit FTE calculations: </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<ul style="list-style: disc;">
		<li>Students with an IEP </li>
		<li>Students in grade 9 or lower </li>
		<li>Students participating in SAL </li>
		<li>Students 21 or older as of December 31 </li>
		<li>Students starting grade 9 in an Ontario secondary school who 
		 are attending their 4th or lower year of secondary school </li>
		<li>Students who did not start grade 9 in an Ontario secondary 
		 school and are less than 18 years old on December 31 </li>
