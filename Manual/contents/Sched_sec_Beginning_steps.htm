<p class="Blue"><a id="1._Initialize_next_year"></a>1. Initialize next 
 year</p>
<p>The scheduling process beings with running the <a href="sched-initialize-scheduling.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Prepare for next year &gt; Initialize next year</a> process. 
  This process duplicates the school information from this year, into 
 the next year.  This makes re-entering last year&#39;s homerooms, advisor 
 groups, courses, classes, and semester/term/day/period information unnecessary 
 if they will be similar for the next year.  It also advances the 
 students’ next year grades.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue"><a id="2._Check_lunches"></a>2. Check lunches</p>
<p>Check that lunch periods are correctly defined, if needed, using <a href="sched-lunches.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Prepare for next 
 year &gt; Lunches</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue"><a id="3._Check_sem_term_day_period_info"></a>3. Check 
 sem/term/day/period info</p>
<p>Check that the number of semesters, terms, periods, and days in cycle 
 are set up correctly for next year using <a href="../setup/setup-class-sem-term-day-pd.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Prepare for next year &gt; Sem/term/day/period</a>. It 
 is very important to make sure the sets and patterns are set up correctly 
 as explained in <a href="Scheduling_important_concepts.htm#Semester_term___day_period_sets_and_patterns__">Important 
 Concepts</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue"><a id="4._Check_courses"></a>4. Check courses</p>
<p>Check that the list of courses is up to date for the courses offered 
 next year. Brand new courses may first need to be added to the <a href="../setup/setup-class-codes.htm">codes</a> 
 table by the board/division/district.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue"><a id="5._Record_course_selections"></a>5. Record course 
 selection</p>
<p>Students typically enter their course selections through edsembli CONNECT 
 or a career planning application (if integration is setup). Those course 
 selections should appear in the edsembli SIS without any action required 
 on the part of the school.  If students are unable to enter course 
 selections, they must be added by the school using any of these options:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><a href="../students/stu-class-info-course-selections.htm">Student 
	 record &gt; Class info &gt; Course selections</a></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><a href="sched-individual-student.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; 
	 Course selections &gt; Individual student</a> or <a href="sched-add-delete-replace-course-selections.htm">Add/delete/replace 
	 course selections</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue"><a id="6._Analyze_course_selections"></a>6. Analyze course 
 selections</p>
<p>Analyze course selections by running these options:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Use <a href="sched-course-tally.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; 
	 Course selections &gt; Course tally</a> to sort by the number of requests 
	 column to identify courses with low interest. If a course is cancelled, 
	 use the <a href="sched-counselling-list.htm">Scheduling next year 
	 &gt; Course selections &gt; Counselling list</a> option to identify 
	 the affected students, and make changes to their course selections.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Further analyze courses using <a href="sched-course-analysis-by-grade.htm">Course 
	 analysis by grad</a>e, <a href="sched-invalid-prerequisites.htm">Invalid 
	 prerequisites</a> and <a href="sched-list-course-selections.htm">List 
	 course selections</a>. Some schools have guidance staff &#39;approve&#39; 
	 each student&#39;s courses.  This feature is available within the 
	 <a href="../students/stu-class-info-course-selections.htm">Course 
	 selections</a> option in each student&#39;s record or using the List Course 
	 selections option.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue"><a id="7._Add_remove_classes"></a>7. Add/remove classes</p>
<p>Use the <a href="sched-class-analysis.htm">class analysis</a> option 
 to create exactly the number of classes needed to meet the needs of next 
 year&#39;s students based on their course selections. It can be used to quickly 
 add and remove classes to the school&#39;s list of <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">classes</a>. 
 <br/>
<br/>
At this point, if there are any changes to rooms for the next year, they 
 should be made to the list of room using <a href="../setup/setup-class-rm-printrm-tt.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Rooms</a>.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="Blue"><a id="8._Add_teacher__room__sem_term__day_period_constraints"></a>8. 
 Add teacher, room, sem/term, day/period constraints</p>
<p style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #000000; 
													 font-weight: normal;">Constraints 
 are the class attributes that the school need to ensure are taken into 
 account as the school&#39;s timetable is created.  The fewer constraints 
 recorded, the more flexibility the scheduling tools have in finding the 
 best placement for a class (the location with the fewest conflicts). These 
 constraints must be recorded by editing the classes with the constraints 
 using <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">Scheduling next year 
 &gt; Classes &gt; Classes</a>:</span></p>
<p style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li style="color: #000000;"><p style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal;">If 
	 a class must be taught by a specific teacher, make sure the teacher 
	 is recorded for the class.</p></li>
	<li style="color: #000000;"><p style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal;">If 
	 a class must be taught in a specific room, make sure the room is recorded 
	 for the class. </p></li>
	<li style="color: #000000;"><p style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal;">If 
	 a class must be taught in a specific semester/term pattern, lock the 
	 class into that pattern (example below)</p></li>
	<li style="color: #000000;"><p style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal;">If 
	 a class must be taught in a specific day/period pattern, lock the 
	 class into that pattern.</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p>You may lock the semester/term pattern and/or the day/period pattern 
 for any class by selecting the lock/unlock icon (<a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">while 
 editing the class</a>).  If you want to ensure that a class remains 
 in a specific semester, then lock the semester/term pattern.  Similarly, 
 if you want to ensure that a class remains in a specific period, then 
 lock the day/period pattern.  The automatic scheduling tool will 
 not change those setting if they are locked.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue"><a id="9._Analyze_base_master_timetable"></a>9. Analyze 
 base master timetable</p>
<p>Before using the tools to schedule classes, it is good to have a &#39;base&#39; 
 timetable that represents the master timetable prior to scheduling classes. 
  Sometimes, conflicts are introduced into the timetable before you 
 even begin using the scheduling tools.  Rather than try to figure 
 out problems after scheduling more classes, it is a good idea to see whether 
 your class constraints are causing any problems.  To analyze the 
 base master timetable, follow these steps:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Check that class schedules are locked only where absolutely necessary. 
	 Hint: you can sort the list of classes by the lock columns.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Check that classes have the correct semester/term and day/period<span> 
	 set</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span>(e.g. make 
	 sure a class doesn&#39;t have a full year set when it is supposed to have 
	 a single semester set; or make sure a class doesn&#39;t have a double 
	 period set when it is supposed to have a single period set).</span> 
	 <br/>
	</li>
	<li>Use <a href="sched-reset-class-schedules.htm">Scheduling next year 
	 &gt; Classes &gt; Reset class schedules</a> to clear out the patterns 
	 for classes that are not locked (and make a snapshot when prompted 
	 as a precaution).  The scheduling tools will assign the patterns 
	 that are best for the class.  <br/>
	</li>
	<li>Run <a href="sched-load-students.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; 
	 Assign students to classes &gt; Load students</a> using the default 
	 options.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>Use <a href="sched-az-conflicts.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; 
	 Analyze master timetable &gt; Analyze conflicts</a> and look at the 
	 results in the analyze conflicts card. This will show courses that 
	 have classes scheduled into the timetable (e.g. class has both a semester/term 
	 and day/period pattern). Look a the Unassigned student column. This 
	 will indicate the number of student who were not able to get into 
	 this class. Depending upon the constraints in the timetable, at this 
	 point there should be very few conflicts (low number of unassigned 
	 students). Select the row to access the Schedule option for each class 
	 (e.g. it will open <a href="sched-master-builder-manual.htm">master 
	 builder - manual</a> for that class and you can see if there is a 
	 better location if you remove one of the constraints).  If any 
	 changes are made to any classes, repeat the load student and analyze 
	 conflicts steps until you are satisfied with the base timetable.<br/>
	<br/>
	  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Blue"><a id="10._Create_snapshot_of_base_timetable"></a>10. 
 Create snapshot of base timetable</p>
<p>Taking a snapshot of this base timetable will ensure that there is always 
 the ability to start all over again, without having to repeat the earlier 
 steps. Create a snapshot using <a href="shed-snapshots.htm">Scheduling 
 next year &gt; Classes &gt; Snapshots</a>. </p>
