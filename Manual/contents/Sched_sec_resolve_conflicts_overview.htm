<h1>Scheduling next year &gt; Resolve student conflicts - Overview</h1>
<p>A student conflict occurs when a student is unable to get into all their 
 preferred courses*. These students will need manual intervention by the 
 school to adjust the student&#39;s timetable. This may involve adding one 
 of the alternate courses to the student&#39;s timetable, or it may involve 
 meeting with the student to pick alternate classes.  If the student 
 was unable to get into more than 1 course, the student with multiple conflicts 
 will have no classes in their timetable.  While editing the student&#39;s 
 timetable, it is possible to see all their preferred courses as &#39;course 
 selections&#39; so that all the class sections are presented and the school 
 can easily build a timetable with as many classes as possible, knowing 
 which classes are most important for the student. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Typically student conflicts are not resolved until the school is done 
 running <a href="sched-load-students.htm">load students</a>. The load 
 students process will rebuild the student&#39;s timetables based on the course 
 selections, potentially undoing any manual conflict resolution done for 
 the student (if the student&#39;s course selections are not updated to reflect 
 the new courses). Resolving student conflicts may be done after transfer 
 to current by editing the student&#39;s this year timetable (hint: use the 
 icon to show preferred requests not yet placed in timetable).   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Resolve student conflict options are used late in the scheduling 
 process, specifically AFTER the school has completed these 2 processes 
 for the very last time:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>the classes are scheduled (the master timetable is complete) AND</li>
	<li>the load students process has been run for the last time.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The tools to resolve student conflicts are as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Students with conflicts</span>: 
	  Use <a href="sched-resolve-stu-conflicts.htm">Scheduling next 
	 year &gt; Resolve student conflicts &gt; Students with conflicts</a> 
	 to identify students who did not get assigned into all their preferred 
	 course selections*. Select a student to automatically open the student&#39;s 
	 next year timetable in edit mode. The course selections that were 
	 not able to be scheduled will appear for reference and the student&#39;s 
	 timetable may be adjusted as needed using the familiar <a href="../students/class-info-timetable.htm">student 
	 timetable</a> functionality.  <br/>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Individual student</span>: Use 
	 <a href="sched-resolve-stu-conflicts-ind-stu.htm">Scheduling next 
	 year &gt; Resolve student conflicts &gt; Individual student</a> to 
	 quickly access the edit next year&#39;s timetable option in a student&#39;s 
	 record. It will default to show the student&#39;s preferred requests not 
	 yet placed in timetable.<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unbalanced timetables</span>: 
	 Use <a href="sched-resolve-stu-conflict-unbal.htm">Scheduling next 
	 year &gt; Resolve student conflicts &gt; Unbalanced timetables</a> 
	 to see students with unbalanced timetables. The weights of the courses 
	 in each student&#39;s timetable are summed for each semester. If the total 
	 weight is different between semesters, this may be an indication of 
	 an unbalanced timetable with respect to the student&#39;s workload.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>* If the load students tool substituted a preferred course with an alternate 
 course, it is not considered a conflict.</p>
