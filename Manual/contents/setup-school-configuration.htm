<h1>Setup &gt; School &gt; School configuration</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As part of the setup area for every school and board/division (central office), there is a configuration area that has a number of varied options that help define how the SIS will operate in each school or from the board/division. The board will not see this card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the main menu select Setup &gt; School. This will take you to the School section.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/school-config-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:189px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select GO on the card to open the School configuration page.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2><a name="Options" id="Options"></a>Options</h2>
<p>This card displays Specialist High Skills Major information (SHSM).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/school-config-options.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:780px;" border="0"/></p>

<h3>Edit options</h3>
<p>Select the edit icon to access the Edit options form. Users with security rights can edit.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Record homeroom internal transfers?</span>: Select check box to indicate yes or no. Set to yes if you want an internal transfer automatically recorded When a student changes homerooms.  If internal transfers exist, it is possible to determine homeroom enrolment numbers on past dates even if the students have since changed homerooms.</p>
<p>Course selection approval (LATER)<br/></p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Timetable changes apply to all semesters?</span>: Select check box to indicate yes or no. If a school has 1 semester this option will not appear. (Available only if the school has multiple semesters)  Set to yes if you do not want timetable add/drops recorded until after the number of days specified into the 2nd, or 3rd, etc semester. For example, if a secondary school has 2 semesters, and 5 days is specified for “Days before recording timetable changes”, then semester 2 timetable changes for the first 5 days in second semester will recorded in the add/drop area as if the student was in the class from the start of the semester (adds will be created, drops will be removed). Changes from the 6th day on will use today’s date to record all class adds and drops.<br/></p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Days before recording timetable changes</span>: Enter a value from 1 to 365. The number of school days to wait before recording add/drop dates for timetable changes.  Enter 1 (the default value) to record the actual date the student added or dropped the class starting after the first day of school. If there are 200 school days, and 200 is entered here, the actual dates that the student’s timetable was changed will never be recorded (it will always be the start of the school year). Elementary schools may want to set this to 200. Some schools may want to start recording add/drop dates after the first couple of weeks of school when they know that timetables are in the process of being inputted (e.g. 10 days).  Note:  number of days refers to dates in the school’s calendar (e.g. typically Monday to Friday, including non-school days such as holidays and PA days).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As classes are added and dropped from a student’s timetable, the dates when the classes were added and/or dropped are automatically recorded. Every class in the student’s timetable must have a corresponding “add” record.  If a student has been in a class since they started school this year, the add date is typically the first day of school. These add/drop dates are important for secondary schools but are not as important for elementary schools.<br/></p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Enable verification?</span>: Select check box to indicate yes or no for address verification. Set to yes if address verification tables have been set up and the school now wants to verify student addresses against the verification tables.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Allow streets outside boundary?</span>: Set to yes if a student’s address may be permitted even if it is not within this school’s boundary. Set to no if a student’s address must be within this school’s boundary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Allow all addresses?</span>: Select check box to indicate yes or no. Set to yes if a student’s address may be any address (allow any address even if it is not standardized).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">SHSM requirements for ‘other credits’ (English, Math, Science, etc)</span>:  Schools cannot edit this field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Click SAVE when you have finished making changes, or CANCEL if you change your mind.</p>
