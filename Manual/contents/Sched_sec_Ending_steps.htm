  <h1>Scheduling next year - Secondary - Part III: Ending steps</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Once <a href="Sched_sec_Scheduling.htm">Part II: Scheduling</a> is done, it is time to complete the ending steps if there are no further plans to adjust when classes are taught and no further plans to run load students (assign classes to students). These steps represent the final steps before the year-end roll over called &#39;transfer to current&#39;.  At this time, students with conflicts in their timetables may have their timetable individually edited, homerooms and advisor groups may be assigned to students, and timetables may be printed if needed.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The previous schools year&#39;s attendance and achievement info must be archived, however this may be done at any point during the scheduling process as long as the school has finished making changes to the current year&#39;s attendance and achievement info.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The roll over is actually performed by the board/district/division. Typically the roll over is done over the summer, before the students start school again in the fall. It cannot be run before the current school year is finished (e.g. it cannot be done in June), nor can it be run when the school still needs the current year&#39;s info for reporting and other processes.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The transfer to current process takes all the &#39;next year&#39; info and copies it into &#39;this year&#39;. This info includes:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>courses</li>
    <li>classes</li>
    <li>rooms</li>
    <li>timetables</li>
    <li>students&#39; grades, homerooms and advisor groups</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Student who are no longer returning to the school become past students, and all other students are assigned the school year status of &#39;this year and next year&#39;.</p>

  <h2><a id="suggested_ending_steps"></a> <span style="font-size:18pt;">Suggested ending steps</span></h2>
  <h3>1. Resolve student conflicts</h3>
  <p>Use <a href="sched-resolve-stu-conflicts.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Resolve student conflicts &gt; Students with conflicts</a> to identify students who did not get assigned into all their preferred course selections*. Select a student to automatically open the student&#39;s next year timetable in edit mode. The course selections that were not able to be scheduled will appear for reference and the student&#39;s timetable may be adjusted as needed using the familiar <a href="../students/class-info-timetable.htm">student timetable</a> functionality.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Resolving student conflicts by editing the student&#39;s timetable does not currently remove the student from the resolve student conflicts list even though the student may be resolved. This list will always reflects the conflicts as of the last time the load students process was run.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>* Note:</strong> if load students substituted a preferred course with an alternate course, it is not considered a conflict.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>2. Assign homerooms and advisor groups</h3>
  <p>If homerooms are used, they should be adjusted to match next year&#39;s needs using <a href="../setup/setup-class-hmrm.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Homerooms &gt; Homerooms.</a> There are many different options to assist in assigning the student&#39;s next year&#39;s homerooms. These options are more convenient than editing each student, one at a time, and there should be one method that works well for your school.  Descriptions of each option below is provided on the card. If printed lists of the students in a homeroom are needed, use the <a href="../students/stu-reports-clist-hmrm.htm">Homeroom lists</a> card to generate those reports.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../students/assign-homeroomsgd.htm">By grade</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-pd.htm">By period</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-class.htm">By class</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-hmrm.htm">By homeroom</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-random.htm">By random group</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-ind-gd.htm">Individual by grade</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../students/assign-homerooms-ind-hmrm.htm">Individual by homeroom</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">If advisor groups are used, they should be adjusted to match next year&#39;s needs using <a href="../setup/setup-class-advisors.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Homerooms &gt; Advisor groups</a>. Advisor groups are similar to homerooms where a room and teacher(s) is/are assigned to the advisor group. The name of the group can be anything the school wants. Some schools use advisor groups to indicate the guidance counselor assigned to the student. Some schools have students meet regularly in groups where the students meet with an advisory teacher to discuss general school related topics.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;">If advisor groups change from year to year, there are many different options to assist in assigning the student&#39;s next year&#39;s advisor groups. These options are more convenient than editing each student, one at a time, and there should be one method that works well for your school.  Descriptions of each option is provided on the card. If printed lists of the students in an advisor group are needed, use the <a href="../students/stu-reports-clist-advisor.htm">Advisor group lists</a> card to generate those reports.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../students/advisor-group-by-grade.htm">By grade</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../students/advisor-group-by-class.htm">By class</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../students/advisor-group-by-advisor-group.htm">By advisor group</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../students/advisor-group-ind-by-grade.htm">Individual by grade</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="../students/advisor-group-ind-by-homeroom.htm">Individual by homeroom</a></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>3. Print timetables</h3>
  <p>Printing timetables for <a href="../students/stu-reports-tt-stu-tt.htm">students</a>, <a href="sched-print-teacher-tt.htm">teachers</a>, <a href="sched-print-room-timetable.htm">rooms</a> is often not necessary in elementary schools, but the option is available if needed. <a href="../students/stu-reports-clist-class.htm">Class lists</a> are also available.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>4. Archive attendance &amp; achievement</h3>
  <p>Run Scheduling next year &gt; Year -end roll over &gt; Archive attendance &amp; achievement. This process may be done at any time during the scheduling process, as long as it is run after the current school year is done and no further attendance or report card data is being entered.  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>5. Transfer to current</h3>
  <p>The board/division/district is responsible for the actual <a href="Transfer_to_current.htm">Transfer to current</a> process. Typically the roll over is done over the summer, before the students start school again in the fall. It cannot be run before the current school year is finished (e.g. it cannot be done in June), nor can it be run when the school still needs the current year&#39;s info for reporting and other processes.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The transfer to current process takes all the &#39;next year&#39; info and copies it into &#39;this year&#39;. This info includes:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>courses</li>
    <li>classes</li>
    <li>rooms</li>
    <li>timetables</li>
    <li>students&#39; grades, homerooms and advisor groups</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Student who are no longer returning to the school become past students, and all other students are assigned the school year status of &#39;this year and next year&#39;.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Once the school has transferred to current, there should be no further use of the Scheduling next year options.  All changes to data need to be done to the &#39;this year&#39; info.</p>
