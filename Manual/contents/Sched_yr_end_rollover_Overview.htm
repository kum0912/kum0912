  <p>Before the start of the new school year, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">school</span> needs to close off the last year and roll-over to the new year. The close off last school year activities include:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Running the option <a href="Archive_attendance___achievement.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Year-end rollover &gt; Archive Attendance &amp; Achievement</a>. This may be done anytime after the previous school year is finished. This option may be run multiple times, with each time only adding changes since the previous time it was run. If it is run in early summer, and again just before transfer to current, the second time it is run will be much faster since it will only need to update differences since the first time it was run.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Generating all necessary lists and reports based on the previous year&#39;s data (e.g. the data in &#39;this year&#39;), including <a href="../achievement/add-completed-courses.htm">updating the student&#39;s completed courses</a> (transcripts) and report cards.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Submitting all data submissions to requesting agencies (e.g. Ministry provincial reporting, federal reporting, post secondary reporting).</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Completing all scheduling activities to the point that you can continue any additional activities in &#39;this year&#39; (e.g. Scheduling next year menu options are not needed any more).</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Before rolling over to the new school year, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">board/division/district</span> must perform the following activities:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Use <a href="sched-manage-yr-end-backups.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Year-end rollover &gt; Manage year-end backups</a> to define schools with similar structures that can roll-over at the same time.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Use <a href="sched-clear-online-reg-data.htm">Scheduling next year &gt; Year-end rollover &gt; Clear online registration data</a> to clear the staging table data for all schools (since all of the registrations should have been processed by now).</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once the school has closed off the last school year, the board/district/division will be responsible for running the <a href="Transfer_to_current.htm">Transfer to new school year</a> process. Transfer to the new year, performs many activities. Here are some examples:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">creates a year-end backup of the data  </span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">copies the student&#39;s next year grade, homeroom, advisor group and timetable into the student&#39;s this year grade, homeroom, advisor group and timetable (and similarly updates the teachers&#39; homerooms, advisor groups and timetables). Creates <a href="../students/enrolment-internal-transfers.htm">internal transfers</a> to show the date the student advanced grades.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">changes the school year status for students/staff as follows:<br />
        &#39;This year only&#39; status changes to &#39;Past&#39;.<br />
        &#39;Withdrawn&#39; status changes to &#39;Past&#39;.<br />
        &#39;Next year only&#39; status changes to &#39;This year and next year&#39;</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">copies the following setup tables from next year to this year: courses, classes, rooms, homerooms, advisor groups.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">sets up the marks and comments based upon the achievement profiles for classes and homerooms.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">sets the <a href="../students/enrolment-students.htm">edsembli record owner</a> to the appropriate school for each student.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Updates locker availability for students who have left the school.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;">Applies course fees where set up.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>While a school is in the process of transferring to current, all access to the school&#39;s data will be prevented.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Once the school has been moved to the new school year, the following activities should be followed:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Scheduling next year option should not be accessed</span>, except for viewing information, if needed.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes will be done using &#39;this year&#39; data, not &#39;next year&#39; data</span>. This includes changes to grades, homerooms, advisor groups, timetables, room, courses, classes. This includes the setup tables and the student/staff data.</span></li>
    <li><span style="line-height:1.5;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit the school calendar</span> to ensure that holidays are defined. Confirm that start/end dates and semester/term dates are correct. Carefully check that the day in the cycle is accurate, and if the school has students who attend on alternate days, the alternate days must also be checked. Use <a href="../setup/setup-calendar.htm">Setup &gt; School &gt; Calendar</a> to do this.</span></li>
  </ul>
