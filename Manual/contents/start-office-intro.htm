<h1>Intro for school office staff</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The school office staff includes all individuals working in the school&#39;s 
 main office, school administrators, guidance and resource staff. Each 
 individual has specific responsibilities that are essential to the operation 
 of the school and edsembli SIS provides the applications you need to perform 
 your job efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By doing our job well, we ensure that you can maintain accurate student 
 information. Pertinent student information is shared with many educational 
 stakeholders, from the government agencies for funding purposes, the board/division/district 
 supervisors, the teachers, the parents/guardians and the students. Depending 
 upon your province and board/division/district, the data may also be shared 
 with other agencies that have permission to this data such as colleges 
 and universities, health units, learning management systems, career counseling 
 applications, data warehouses, to name just a few possible examples. Without 
 a doubt, all school office staff are key participants in the maintenance 
 of accurate student data and are the vital link between the student and 
 all education stakeholders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For most schools, by the time you start using edsembli SIS, most of 
 the setup has been done as part of the implementation, and the student 
 data has been added. Based on this assumption, we would suggest you first 
 start with the Student Records portion of the manual. Each student in 
 the database has a student record which provides easy access to the wealth 
 of data recorded for the student.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once you have an understanding of the type of data that is available, 
 read the sections of the manual that pertain to the functions used to 
 build that data (such as attendance, achievement, and scheduling). Become 
 familiar with the reports that are available, particularly if you are 
 responsible for provincial, federal, and other agency reporting. There 
 are some setup areas that you need to be familiar with, particularly if 
 you are responsible for maintaining the master list of homerooms or classes 
 in the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are a school administrator with teaching duties as well, please 
 make sure you also read the section called Introduction for teachers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We also strongly suggest that all users of edsembli SIS, read the section 
 titled <a href="start-common-features.htm">Common Features</a> which explains 
 features of the application that are the same regardless of your role 
 and access rights.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For most boards/divisions/districts, by the time you start using edsembli 
 SIS, most of the setup has been done as part of the implementation, and 
 the school and student data has been added. Based on this assumption, 
 we would suggest you first start with the Student Records portion of the 
 manual. Each student in the database has a student record which provides 
 easy access to the wealth of data recorded for the student. Typically, 
 central office staff have view rights to student data only, with all edits 
 performed by those with permissions in the schools.</p>
