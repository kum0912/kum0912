<p>This report lists the students in a class along with their daily attendance 
 entered for any selected month. This report applies only to those schools 
 that have students with the ‘by period’ attendance method, where attendance 
 is recorded each time a class is taught. port.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Choose Attendance &gt; Reports &gt; Class attendance or Student reports 
 &gt; Attendance &gt; Class attendance and select RUN on the Class attendance 
 card. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep37.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:204px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The Attendance reports - Class attendance screen will appear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep-class-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:612px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Order</span> - Prior to generating 
 the report, the setup of the report parameters should be examined to ensure 
 that you generate the desired report.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the semester and term (if applicable) corresponding to the classes 
 to be included in the report. If a school has 2 semesters and 2 terms, 
 selecting semester 1 term 1 will consider any class that is taught during 
 semester 1 term 1. This includes year-long classes, semester 1 classes, 
 and classes taught in semester 1 term 1 only. This does not include classes 
 that are taught in semester 1 term 2 only. The semester and term 
 drop down lists include “All” options (e.g. All terms would include any 
 class taught in term 1 and any class taught in term 2). Classes that 
 are not scheduled into a period are automatically excluded from the report 
 since attendance is not recorded for these classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the semester and term are selected, choose whether the report is 
 to be generated for the classes in alphabetical order, in order by the 
 teacher’s surname, or individually (pick one class at a time). For the 
 alphabetical and teacher orders, the first and last classes may be changed 
 from the defaults. For the individual order, select the one class to be 
 printed. Here is an example showing the alphabetical order:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Report parameters</span> - The report 
 parameters allow you to select the month to be printed as well as the 
 optional information to be included in the report.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Include legend</span>: If selected, 
 a legend explaining the calendar and attendance codes will appear below 
 the student’s attendance. <a href="att-rep-common-features.htm#Legends">See 
 Common features – Legends</a> for more information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Include withdrawn students</span>: Check 
 this box if the list of students in the class is to include those students 
 who were enrolled in the class but have since left the school (Maplewood 
 status is set to Withdrawn).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Include dropped students</span>: Check 
 this box if the list of students in the class is to include those students 
 who were enrolled in the class but have since dropped the class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Include class summary</span>: Check 
 this box if a statistical summary is to be included at the end of the 
 report. This summary lists the classes on the report, along with statistical 
 information based on the selected month’s attendance for each class. Here 
 is an example of the class summary that will appear as the last page in 
 the report:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep40.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:685px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The statistical information is based on the attendance codes assigned 
 to the students. The definition of the attendance codes will determine 
 whether the student is considered Present, Late, Absent or Excused as 
 explained in <a href="att-important-concepts.htm#Attendance_codes_and_reasons">Attendance 
 – Important concepts – Attendance codes and reasons</a>. The following 
 statistical information is provided.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attending 
 Class (P or L) %</span>: This provides a statistic indicating what 
 percent of the time students actually attended the class during the month. It 
 considers those students who were present or late to class. It is 
 the sum of the P or L attendance codes in the month / # of possible school 
 days for all the students in the class.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Missing 
 Class (A or E) %</span>: This provides a statistic indicating what percent 
 of the time students did not attend the class during the month (e.g. 
 they missed the class). It considers those students who were absent 
 or excused from class. It is the sum of those attendance codes defined 
 as class absent or excused / # of possible school days for all the students 
 in the class.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Present 
 %</span>: This is the sum of those attendance codes defined as present 
 / # of possible school days for all the students in the class.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Late %</span>: 
 This is the sum of those attendance codes defined as late / # of possible 
 school days for all the students in the class.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Absent %</span>: 
 This is the sum of those attendance codes defined as absent / # of possible 
 school days for all the students in the class.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Excused 
 %</span>: This is the sum of those attendance codes defined as excused 
 / # of possible school days for all the students in the class.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Number of 
 Students</span>: This is the number of students included in the report 
 for the class.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overall</span>: The 
 statistics above considering all the student in all the classes included 
 in the report.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Sample report</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep35.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:703px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each student, the attendance recorded for that class is listed under 
 each date in the month. Using the first student in the report, looking 
 at the attendance for the month of November (enlarged below), the student 
 was absent 3 times during the month (2 A codes, 1 X code). This month 
 has 1 holiday (h), and 2 grant days (gr), for 18 possible days. The tot. 
 column shows 3/18 corresponding to 3 absences out of 18 possible days 
 in November. The Acc. column represents the total absences and possible 
 days since the start of the class. The %P column represent the percent 
 of time this year that the student has been present for class. Using this 
 example, the student was present 47 days (56 possible days – 9 absences). 
 The 83% present is calculated from 47 present days/56 possible days x 
 100.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The student was absent 1 time this month, for an accumulated late total 
 of 5 since the start of the class.</p>

<p>Note the __ for the 27th and 30th of the month represents future dates.</p>
