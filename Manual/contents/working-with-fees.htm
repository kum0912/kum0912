<h1 style="margin-right: 0px;">Fees &gt; Student fees</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify;

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fees are school-specific, however, with permissions, you may see the 
 fees recorded by another school. The school creates a list of fee types 
 to broadly describe the type of fee. Examples might include course fee, 
 bus fee, student activity fee, lock purchase. When you apply a fee to 
 a student or group of students you can add comments to help clarify the 
 fee. As fee payments are made to the student’s account, you can easily 
 track how much the student still owes. You can also set up deposits for 
 borrowed items such as text book. Deposit funds that are collected at 
 the start of the course can then be returned after the student returns 
 the text book. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When a fee (charge) is added to a student’s record, it will appear on 
 Account Bills and other similar reports as a C with their respective invoice 
 number.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="Add_a_fee"></a>Add a fee</h3>
<p>When a fee (charge) is added to a student’s record, it will appear on 
 Account Bills and other similar reports as a C with their respective invoice

<p class="Blue">• <a id="Individual"></a>Individual student (using two 
 access points)</p>

 </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/individual-student.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:190px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Choose the student from the <a href="../students/stu-overview.htm#Select_a_student">standard 
 select student form</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. Choose Student records and select the student. Then select Fees from 
 the submenu.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/add-fee-icon.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:670px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To add group fees see<a href="fees-group-fees.htm"> Group fees for more 
 information</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Add a fee main screen</h3>
<p>When you add a fee this is the form you will use to add information. 
 If you are adding a fee to an individual student you won&#39;t see the Select 
 by area. This is only relevant when adding a fee to a group of students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/add-fee-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:760px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>    </p>
<p>These are the <a id="add_fee_fields"></a>Add fee fields:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Amount</span>: 
  The dollar amount of the fee in the format ##.## (e.g. enter 12.50 
 for a $12.50 fee, or enter 12 for a $12.00 fee, there is no need to enter 
 the dollar sign). Entries must be a positive number.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Date</span>: 
  The date of the transaction (it will default today’s date but may 
 be changed to any date as long as it falls within the range of 1 year 
 before or after today’s date).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Fee 
 type</span>:  Select the type from the list of possible types defined 
 by your school.  Example types might be Student activity fee, Yearbook, 
 Lock purchase, etc.  See Setup fee types for additional information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="color: #ff00ff; margin-left: 40px;">Invoice number:  The 
 invoice number is automatically assigned, but if needed, it can be changed 
 to any alphanumeric value as long as it is a unique number.  The 
 application will automatically default the next available invoice number 
 based on the starting invoice number set up for the school.  See 
 Setup ….</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Payment 
 due date</span>:  Enter the date the payment is due.  This field 
 only appears if the school is set up to record due dates (see Setup ….). 
  If the payment is not received by this date, the fee will be included 
 in the “Overdue unpaid fees”. The date can be any date after the date 
 of the transaction.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Applied 
 taxes</span>:  If the fee is taxable, select the tax to be applied 
 from the list of tax types (e.g. GST).  It will default the taxes 
 associated with the fee type, but it may be removed if appropriate.  This 
 field only appears if the school has defined at least one tax type as 
 part of the set up (where the tax rate is also defined). <a href="../setup/setup-fees--taxes.htm"> See 
 Setup</a> ….</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Total 
 taxes</span>:  If a tax type was selected in the Applied taxes field, 
 the dollar amount of the taxes will appear here.  This field is not 
 editable as it is automatically calculated based on the tax rate (e.g. 
 if a tax is applied with a rate of .05 (5%), a $10 fee will show $0.50 
 for the total taxes). This field only appears if tax types have been set 
 up.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Comment 
 bank</span>: You will see the comment bank only if the school has set 
 up a list of comments (see Setup ….)).  The comment bank lets you 
 select from a list of predefined comments. To use this feature, select 
 the drop down arrow to select the desired comment, then select the Copy 
 icon to place the comment in the comment field.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Comments</span>: 
  You can record a comment when you add a fee.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class="Blue">Dialogue messages</p>
<p>When you save a fee is, you may see a dialogue message relating to account 
 limits if the school has set up either of these account limits as (see 
 Setup … for details on setting up these limits):</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li style="margin-left: -20px;">A school can set up an account limit 
	 so that a student’s outstanding (unpaid) fees cannot exceed a set 
	 maximum. If an account limit is set up, and if the addition of a new 
	 fee will exceed that amount, you will see this dialogue message:</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: normal; color: #007fff;">This student has an account 
 balance that exceeds the school’s account limit.  Do you wish to 
 override this limit?  CANCEL     YES, ADD NEW 
 FEE</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li style="margin-left: -20px;">A school can set up a fee type limit 
	 so that a student’s outstanding fees for that type cannot exceed a 
	 set maximum. For example, a school may set up a student activity fee 
	 type with an upper limit of $50.00.  When adding a new student 
	 activity fee type with a fee greater than $50, a dialogue will be 
	 presented as follows :<br/>
	</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0px; color: #007fff;">This fee amount is greater 
 than the limit set by the school.  Do you wish to override this limit? 
  CANCEL     YES, ADD NEW FEE</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">You will also see this dialogue if a fee amount 
 plus the outstanding fees for this type exceed the upper limit (e.g. new 
 student activity fee is $25 and student already has outstanding student 
 activity fees of $30).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">When adding a fee, if the student has payment 
 credits, the user will be prompted asking if they would like to apply 
 the credits. See Payment credits for more details.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<h2><a id="Edit_fees"></a>Edit fees</h2>
<p>Once a fee is assigned to a student, you can make changes, but editing 
 the fee has some rules:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>You can make edits to the date of the transaction, the payment 
	 due date (if applicable), and comments.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>All fee, or tax type edits need a comment to explain the reason 
	 for the amount change. <br/>
	<br/>
	<span style="font-style: italic;">Technical notes:  The invoice 
	 number cannot be edited, but it will automatically include ‘A-‘ before 
	 the number (e.g. A-1112) to indicate that the fee amount has been 
	 adjusted.  In most places, the new amount will appear with the 
	 original invoice number, however, in the database, it will record 
	 the original entry followed by transactions with the adjustments (e.g. 
	 if the original fee was $25 and then it was changed to $20, the database 
	 has 2 transactions:  the original invoice 1112 with $25 and A-1112 
	 with ($5.00).  Some reports will show this as the 2 transactions. 
	 If a fee has been edited, only the new amount ($20.00) will appear 
	 on a student’s record, not the original amount ($25.00).</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/edi-fee.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:750px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you edit (adjust) a charge that has a payment associated with it, 
 you will see a warning message.</p>
