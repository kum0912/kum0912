  <p class="Style1">This tool provides a quick way to assign homerooms based on the student’s grades. This is much faster than editing each student’s homeroom, one at a time.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For small schools where there is only one homeroom for the grade, this option can be used to assign all the students in the grade into the one homeroom. For example, if all students in grade 3 have the same homeroom, use this tool to specify grade 3 and the homeroom to be assigned.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For larger schools where there are 2 or more homerooms for the grade, this option can be used to let the application assign the students into the homerooms. For example, if 2 homerooms were assigned to the students in grade 3, the application would equally distribute all the grade 3 students into the 2 homerooms, by alternating the students alphabetically by surname. It assigns the first student alphabetically into the first homeroom, the second student into the second homeroom, the third student into the first homeroom, the fourth student into the second homeroom, etc. Once the process is done, individual students may be re-assigned to a different homeroom (from the student’s record, or through the other homeroom tools such as Individual by grade or Individual by homeroom where it lists all the students along with the homeroom field for editing).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A student has a homeroom for the current school year and the forthcoming school year, where applicable. Therefore, this tool is available for assigning this year’s or next year’s homerooms.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When a student’s current year’s homeroom is changed, a dated record of the change is stored in the student’s internal transfers. Internal transfers are accessible from the Internal transfers option within the Enrolment area of the student’s record.  Along with the date of the change, the program records the student’s original homeroom and the new homeroom.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>To access this tool, select the Menu icon in the left corner, then select Student tools, then Homerooms. This will take you to the Homerooms section where you will find the By grade card.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>Assigning homerooms</h2>
  <p>From the main menu choose Student tools &gt; Homerooms.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Select THIS YEAR or NEXT YEAR on the By grade card, depending on whether homerooms are to be assigned to this year’s or next year’s homerooms.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-hmrm2.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 235px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The Homeroom - By grade screen will appear:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-hmrm3.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 622px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">First, select the grade of the students whose homerooms need to be changed. Each student has a grade for the current (this) school year and the upcoming (next) school year, where applicable. If changing the students’ this year’s homeroom, select the current grade of the students. If you are changing the students’ next year’s homeroom, then select the next year’s grade of the students.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"> </p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Next, select the homeroom or homerooms selected by using the drop down arrow to see the list of homerooms in the school. Check the box beside the homeroom or homerooms to be assigned (if multiple homerooms are selected, the students will be equally distributed amongst the homerooms).</p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"> </p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-hmrm4.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:623px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"> </p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Once the grade and homeroom(s) information is selected, select the ASSIGN button at the bottom of the page. Once the process is complete, the students will be changed to their newly assigned homerooms.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"> </p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Depending upon your school’s report card setup, sometimes report card information is tied to the student’s homeroom. This information may include marks (such as overall student learning skills), comments (such as an overall comment on the student), and programs (such as IEP, ESL). If the report card information cannot be transferred because the original and the new homerooms are not setup the same way, you&#39;ll see this message.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"> </p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-hmrm5.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:251px;" /></p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"> </p>
  <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;">We would suggest you view the list of students, unless you know that teachers have not yet begun report card entries. If you examine the report card information for the students, you will be able to see the information for both the old (deleted) homeroom and the current homeroom. If required, transfer tools are available.</p>
