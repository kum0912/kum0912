<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>Sometimes a school/board/division/district would like to record information 
 about a student, but there is no field currently available for the entry 
 of that information. Custom fields, aka user-definable fields, can be 
 created for these situations. Custom fields may be defined by the school 
 or centrally by the board/division/district using <a href="../setup/setup-custom-fields.htm">Setup 
 &gt; User-defined fields &gt; Custom fields</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fields may be grouped so that similar fields may appear together in 
 the student’s record, on a card with a title that corresponds to the group. 
  For example, a board may want to record information about whether 
 or not the student may be interviewed by the media, photographed by the 
 media, videotaped by the media, whether the student’s work can be displayed, 
 whether the student’s image may appear on the website or social media, 
 etc. All these fields may be grouped together in a card called FOIP permission 
 (FOIP = Freedom of Information and Protection) so that the fields appear 
 together in each student’s record.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Group titles may be defined centrally by the board/division/district, 
 or by the school. By default, centrally defined fields will have at least 
 one group with the default title of “General – Central ”, and school defined 
 fields will have a group called “General - School”. Groups that don’t 
 have any fields will not appear in the students’ records.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The setup of the centrally defined custom fields will determine whether 
 the fields are student-specific, in other words, the information entered 
 into the field is the same regardless of what school the student attends. 
 Only the school that is considered the edsembli record owner can edit 
 these fields. For example, if centrally defined custom fields were set 
 up to record a student’s physical characteristics such as eye colour, 
 height and blood type, then these fields should be setup as student-specific. 
 These fields would appear for all students at all schools (but editable 
 only by the edsembli record owner). If, on the other hand, these fields 
 were defined by a school, they would only be available for the students 
 in that school only.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sometimes a centrally defined custom field is setup so that each school 
 can record its own unique values for the fields in that category. Centrally 
 defined groups can contain both school and student-specific fields.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The Custom fields menu option in a student’s record provides easy access 
 to these custom fields. Custom fields are available for current, past 
 and future students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To access a student’s custom fields, from the student’s record, select 
 Custom fields from the menu. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/custodyicon.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:25px;" border="0"/>`</p>
<p>   </p>
<h3><a id="Custom_fields"></a>Custom fields</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Custom fields option will show the user-defined fields in cards. 
 In the example below, the &#39;General&#39; cards are collapsed (by default all 
 cards are expanded).  The title of each card is user defined, but 
 the General cards are the default group titles (they won&#39;t appear if there 
 are no fields are setup in the General group). </p>

<h2><a name="Editing_custom_fields" id="Editing_custom_fields"></a>Editing 
 custom fields</h2>
<p>If one field needs editing, the fastest way to do this is to select 
 the field on the card. This will open up the edit for just that one field. 
 Entry instructions, if defined as part of the setup, will appear beside 
 the field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/custom-fields3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:528px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If multiple fields require editing, use the Edit icon on the card to 
 access all the fields on one form.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/custom-fields4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1054px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the field has been set up with instructions to the user (to help 
 them understand the purpose of the field or how it is to be entered), 
 select the info icon located beside the field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note: Yes/No fields will actually have 3 possible values (Yes, No, Not 
 assigned) and will be set using a drop down list. Not assigned will appear 
 until the student is intentionally set to yes or no.</p>
