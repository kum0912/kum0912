<h1>Enrolment registers - Full-time</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<p>The full-time option provides Ontario schools and boards with the ability 
 to generate the official enrolment registers for full-time students, and 
 unofficial register reports for school/board use.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Schools and boards should be familiar with the official Ministry enrolment 
 register instructions for elementary and secondary schools that are updated 
 annually on the Ministry’s site <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html">http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html</a>l. 
 The principal will ensure that a system is in place to determine whether 
 a pupil is to be enrolled as a Full-Time (described here) or a <a href="on-ereg-part-time.htm">Part-Time</a> 
 pupil, or as a secondary pupil engaged in <a href="on-ereg-IS-elearning-day-schools.htm">Independent 
 Study</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In general, a pupil’s enrolment status is based on the number of minutes 
 a pupil is “registered for classroom instruction” per school day. A full-time 
 pupil is typically registered for 210 minutes or more of classroom instruction 
 per school day. The term “registered for classroom instruction” refers 
 to a pupil who is enrolled for classroom instruction and who is attending 
 classes regularly. The amount of time specified for classroom instruction 
 in each case is the average amount of time in the school cycle that is 
 allocated in the pupil’s timetable to the classes that the pupil is expected 
 to attend. See the Ministry’s instructions for details on time recognized 
 or not recognized as classroom instructional time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Full-time pupils attending elementary and secondary schools include:</p>
<p>  </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>A pupil who is registered for classroom instruction for an average 
	 of 210 minutes or more per school day in the school cycle  </li>
	<li>A pupil aged 14–17 who has a Supervised Alternative Learning Plan 
	 (SALP) that provides for an average of at least 70 minutes of instruction 
	 per school day in which the pupil may earn a credit  </li>
	<li>A pupil who is participating in an Intensive Behavioural Intervention 
	 program, regardless of the amount of classroom instructional time 
	 for which he or she is registered</li>
	<li>A secondary pupil who is enrolled in a day school that has a school 
	 year calendar (12 month calendar under Regulation 304), in which the 
	 pupil is eligible to earn at least 7 credits during the school year.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The full-time register reports will rely on the information recorded 
 for the students. Please be familiar with the <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a> option in the student’s record. This 
 will provide detailed information on the enrolment register(s) the student 
 will appear on, as well as high credit and regular FTE/ADE info. Hint: 
 on the FTE and/or ADE card in the student’s record, there’s a Details 
 section that may be expanded to show info on how FTE/ADE is calculated, 
 and how the student’s data impacts the register. Typically, full-time 
 students are (or were) recorded as full-time in the attendance type field, 
 at some point this school year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To access the full-time register reports, choose Ontario reporting &gt; 
 Enrolment registers &gt; Full-time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:202px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select GO on the Full-time card and you will see a form like this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:676px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are 3 official registers formats for full-time students as per 
 the Ministry’s instructions. Use the tabs to navigate between the 3 formats. 
 It will default the DETAILS tab.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-main2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:717px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="#DETAILS_tab_">DETAILS</a> - generates the Enrolment Details 
 register for full-time pupils.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="#MONTHLY_SUMMARY_tab">MONTHLY SUMMARY</a> – generates the Monthly 
 Enrolment Summary for full-time pupils.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="#SUMMARY__FTE__tab_">SUMMARY (FTE)</a> - generates the Enrolment 
 Summary with regular and high-credit FTE data. This register is required 
 for full-time secondary pupils who are under 21 years of age.  This 
 option applies to schools with students in grades 9 or higher.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All tabs provide similar functionality for generating the reports.  First 
 set the options on the page (as detailed below), then select the Print 
 button located at the bottom of the form. Once the report has been submitted 
 to the task queue, you may leave this application or generate other reports. 
 You will receive notification when your report is ready. Reports are saved 
 in <a href="../setup/setup-file-manager.htm">file manager</a> under Provincial 
 &gt; Enrolment registers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="DETAILS_tab_" id="DETAILS_tab_"></a>DETAILS tab</h3>
<p>The DETAILS tab will generate the official full-time enrolment details 
 registers. Each of the following grade groups has a distinct register:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Junior kindergarten</li>
	<li>Kindergarten</li>
	<li>Grades 1 to 3</li>
	<li>Grades 4 to 8</li>
	<li>Secondary students (Grades 9 to 12)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The grade groups available will depend upon the grades offered at the 
 school. The board will have access to all groups. Select the grade groups 
 to be printed or select the Print all registers option (one register per 
 group will be printed).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-main3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:458px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Typically, the registers are printed Alphabetically, but schools may 
 opt to print it by homeroom (referred to as an organizational group in 
 the Ministry’s instructions).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-main4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:337px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example from the Ministry’s instructions. An Adult column 
 will appear for the secondary students (grade 9-12 group). An adult student 
 is a pupil who is already 21 years of age or over or who will turn 21 
 on or before December 31.  The ‘OP’ column will show OP if the student 
 is considered an Other Pupil (OP). OP will appear if the board defined 
 student board residence status does not use ministry code 01, 06, 07, 
 or 09.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-main5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:604px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Unofficial option will provide the same register report, however, 
 the students are not in the official grade groups.  For example, 
 all the students in the school, who were full-time at some point, may 
 be printed in an unofficial register.  The standard print methods 
 are available, but the “Alphabet” option is defaulted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-main6.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:603px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For elementary schools, the unofficial reports will reference “All Grades” 
 rather than an official grade group.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-main7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:716px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="MONTHLY_SUMMARY_tab" id="MONTHLY_SUMMARY_tab"></a>MONTHLY 
 SUMMARY tab</h3>
<p>The MONTHLY SUMMARY tab will generate the Ministry’s monthly enrolment 
 summary of full-time students. When selected, the form will look like 
 this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-main8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:736px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This register has the same options as the DETAILS tab, however, if printing 
 the register summary for grade 9-12 students, distinct registers are needed 
 for school age students (under 21 years of age as of December 31) and 
 adult students.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example from the Ministry’s instructions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-main9.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:720px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Unofficial option will provide the same register report, however, 
 the students are not in the grade groups.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-main11.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:598px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="SUMMARY__FTE__tab_" id="SUMMARY__FTE__tab_"></a>SUMMARY (FTE) 
 tab</h3>
<p>The SUMMARY (FTE) tab will generate the Ministry’s enrolment summary 
 with regular and high-credit data for full-time students in grades 9-12. 
 When the SUMMARY (FTE) tab is selected, the form will look like this: 
  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-main12.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:718px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This register is typically printed for the entire school, but there 
 is the option to print just for a group of students (alphabet order or 
 other orders), and there is the option to print by homeroom.  There 
 are distinct reports for school aged students and adult students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The student’s FTE info as of 2 count dates (typically the last school 
 day in October and March).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example from the Ministry’s instructions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/on-ereg-full-time-main13.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:574px;" border="0"/></p>
