<p>Adding a payment for a group fee</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Often, the same fee is added to a group of students.  For example, 
 all students in the school may be required to pay a student activity fee, 
 or all students in grades 9 and higher have a locker fee, or all students 
 in the visual arts class are going on a trip to the art gallery.  Fees 
 can be added to a group of students quickly using the Group fee option.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When a group fee is created, you create a transaction name to describe 
 the group fee, and provide the fee details such as the fee type and amount 
 of the fee.  The group of students is selected from the standard 
 student group options, including a random group which allows you to group 
 students that aren’t typically grouped together. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the group fee is applied, each student in the group will have the 
 fee automatically added to their fees. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note:  Group fees does not check each student in the group to see 
 if payment credits exist for the student, and therefore it will not ask 
 if the payment credit can be applied as payment for the newly added fee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Group fees function will list all the group fees that have been 
 created.  Select the group fee to access the Payment option. The 
 students associated with that group fee will be listed.  It will 
 default to display only the students who have not yet fully paid the fee. 
  Payment information may be entered and then applied to all or some 
 of the students in the group.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To access Group fees choose Fees &gt; Student fees and select OK on 
 the Group fees card..</p>

<p>  </p>
<p><a id="add_group_fee"></a>The Add fee page will appear:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/add-group-fee-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:760px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The fields are the same as those required when <a href="working-with-fees.htm#Add_a_fee">adding 
 a fee to a single student</a>, except for one new field called <span style="font-weight: bold; 
	 color: #007fff;">Transaction name</span>.  Enter a meaningful 
 name that will help describe the group fee (e.g. Grade 8 trip to Ottawa). 
 For details on the other fields, see <a href="working-with-fees.htm#Add_a_fee">Add 
 a fee</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Below the fee fields, use the standard ‘Select by&#39; area to select the 
 group of students who require this fee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following options are available:  Alphabet, group, grade, homeroom, 
 class, defined character, inquiry list , excursion list, advisor group, 
 and bus routes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select SAVE at the bottom of the page to add the fee to all the students 
 in the group.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note:  Once you have added the group 
 fee is added, you can make changes to individual students from the fees 
 area of the student’s record, or by editing the group fee as explained 
 below.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="Edit_a_group_fee"></a>Edit a group fee</h3>
<p>Row click the group fee and select Edit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/group-transactions.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:635px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Edit group fee form will appear:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/edit-group-transactions.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:617px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Enter the adjusted fee information at the top of the Edit group fee 
 form.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the students whose information will be adjusted or check the 
 box in the header to place a check mark beside all students. When 
 you select a student, the adjusted fee information will appear for that 
 student. If necessary, you can edit the fee amount and comment for 
 individual students after the box is checked.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Select SAVE at the bottom of the page to save the new fee information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Important notes:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The  check box is not available for those students who have 
	 had fee amounts adjusted individually from the group fee (e.g. it 
	 was previously edited in the student’s record).  This is to prevent 
	 the accidental change to a student’s fees that were intentionally 
	 adjusted for another reason.  If the check box is not available, 
	 edits must be done via the fee’s area of the student’s records.</li>
	<li>If a student has made a payment for this fee, and the fee amount 
	 is reduced such that the student paid more than the new fee, a payment 
	 credit is automatically created.</li>
	<li>If taxes apply to this fee, the total with taxes will appear for 
	 each student.  It is possible to enter a  different fee 
	 amount for a student (by editing the fee amount beside the student’s 
	 name).  If this is necessary for a fee with taxes, enter the 
	 amount before taxes.  Taxes will be automatically calculated 
	 and the total including taxes will automatically appear for the fee. 
	 </li>
	<li>The Group transaction card will show the fee amounts.  If 
	 students have different fee amounts because of edits after group fee 
	 was applied, it will how a range in this column (e.g. $10.00 - $15.00).</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="Voiding_a_group_fee"></a>Voiding a group fee</h3>
<p>The Void option can be used to delete the group fee.  It will void 
 the fee for all students in the group.  Voided fees will not appear 
 on the student’s record or any reports.  There is however an audit 
 trail, and there is a record of this in the database for audit purposes 
 if needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Row click a group fee and select Void. You&#39;ll need to answer a confirmation 
 message.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/void-group-fee.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:617px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note:  If the fee has a payment, when the fee is voided, the payment 
 will be converted to a payment credit which can be refunded or applied 
 to other fees.  See Payment credits for details.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a id="Adding_a_payment_for_a_group_fee"></a>Adding a payment for 
 a group fee</h3>
<p>Typically, payments are entered for each student individually, however, 
 a group payment may be useful if someone collects the fee on behalf of 
 the group of students (e.g. a teacher collects the field trip money) and 
 then submits the money to the office for all students with that fee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can use the payment option apply the same payment amount to everyone 
 who received the group fee by row clicking the group fee and selecting 
 Payment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/add-group-payment.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:506px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Enter the payment information at the top of the Add group payment form. 
 <br/>
<br/>
<img src="assets/images/add-group-payment1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:630px;" border="0"/><br/>
</p>
<p>Select the students whose information will be adjusted or check the 
 box in the header to place a check mark beside all students. When 
 you select a student, the adjusted fee information will appear for that 
 student. If necessary, you can edit the fee amount and comment for 
 individual students after the box is checked.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Select SAVE at the bottom of the page to save the new fee information.</p>
