  <p> </p>
  <p>These concepts set the foundation for understanding attendance.</p>
  <h4><a name="Determining_when_a_student_is_expected_to_attend_school" id="Determining_when_a_student_is_expected_to_attend_school"></a>Determining when a student is expected to attend school</h4>
  <p>Every student in a school may have daily attendance recorded for each day that the student is expected to show up to school. Typically you would enter attendance for the current date, but you can enter attendance for any date in the current school year, past or future, as long as the student is enrolled in school on that date.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
  <p>A student’s entry date to this school and exit/retirement date, if applicable, are criteria considered when determining whether the student is expected to be at school. If a student has multiple entry and exit/retirement dates, these dates are also considered.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For students with the ‘by period’ attendance method, the timetables must exist because the attendance is recorded for the classes the student is taking in each period on each date. Class add and drop dates are also considered to determine accurately recorded class attendance.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The school’s calendar defines which days are non-school days and no attendance would be recorded. Sometimes, a regular school day becomes a non-school day due to bad weather or some mechanical issue forces the closure of the school. If all students in the school are affected by the closure, see <a href="#Unexpected_school_closure">Unexpected school closure</a>.</p>
  <h4><a name="By_period_vs_morning_afternoon_attendance_" id="By_period_vs_morning_afternoon_attendance_"></a>By period vs morning/afternoon attendance</h4>
  <p>Each student has an attendance method field that determines how many times a student’s daily attendance is recorded. The attendance method field is located in the <a href="../students/class-info-classes.htm#Grade_info">Grade info card</a> available from the Class info, Classes menu in the student’s record.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Elementary students typically have morning/afternoon attendance recorded. Secondary students typically have attendance recorded for each period where the student is expected to show up to a class. A school with kindergarten to grade 12 students may require both attendance methods. See <a href="att-setup.htm">Setup - Parameters</a> for information on how to set up the method(s) required by your school and how to set the default attendance method for each grade in the school.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>There are 2 possible attendance methods:</p>
  <h5>1. By period</h5>
  <p>With this method, attendance is entered for each class in the student’s timetable.  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-1.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:210px;" /></p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-11.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:355px;" /></p>
  <p>If a class is not assigned a specific period, or if it is not taught today, then you cannot record attendance. If a student has an alternate day schedule (e.g. the student does not attend school every day), attendance cannot be recorded on the days where the student does not attend.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If your school has classes that span multiple periods, be sure to check that your attendance parameters are set up to reflect whether you want to enter attendance only once for these classes or if you want to enter attendance for each period. When a student is absent for a multi-period class, the parameters let you determine if the absent is counted as 1 day or is counted for each of the periods (e.g. count as 2 if student missed a double period class). See <a href="att-setup.htm">Setup - Parameters</a> for details.</p>
  <h5>2. Morning/Afternoon</h5>
  <p>With this method, attendance is entered twice a day, corresponding to the morning and the afternoon attendance:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-2.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:176px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Students with the morning/afternoon attendance method will also need to ensure that the attendance type field is also set accurately. The attendance type will indicate if a student is attending half time AM or PM only, or full time, or full days on alternate days, etc. For example, a Half Time (AM) attendance type will mean that only morning attendance may be recorded for the student. Both the attendance method and attendance type fields are in the <a href="../students/class-info-classes.htm#Grade_info">Grade info card</a> available from the Class info, Classes menu in the student’s record.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-3.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:505px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If a school has students attending full days on alternate days (e.g. half time kindergarten student comes Monday, Wednesday and every other Friday), make sure the school’s calendar has the alternate day schedule defined correctly. See <a href="att-setup.htm">Setup – Calendar</a> for more information.</p>
  <h3><a name="Attendance_codes_and_reasons" id="Attendance_codes_and_reasons"></a>Attendance codes and reasons</h3>
  <p>Attendance is recorded using a list of attendance codes and reasons that may be defined centrally by the board/division or by the school. The attendance code A is reserved for Absent, and P is reserved for Present, but all other letters of the alphabet are user defined. An unlimited number of reasons may be associated with each code to further classify the attendance code. For example, a school might have a L – Late attendance code with 3 reasons: L – Late – Missed bus, L – Late – Slept in, L – Late - Other. Reasons are optional as some schools prefer to enter the reason in the student’s attendance notes.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If a student is absent and you know the reason, then record attendance using the appropriate code and not just Absent. For example, if the student is absent due to an appointment, rather than recording A - Absent, the attendance should be recorded using an alternate attendance code such as M - Medical appointment, or M - Medical appointment – dentist (if reasons are defined).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>We recommend that reasons are not defined for A – Absent so that this code may be used to quickly identify the students with unexplained absences.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Some schools/boards/divisions set up attendance codes only. Each code is defined with a letter and a title. For example,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A - Absent</p>
  <p>F – Field trip</p>
  <p>I - Ill</p>
  <p>L - Late</p>
  <p>M – Medical appointment</p>
  <p>P – Present</p>
  <p>T – Team event</p>
  <p>W – With reason</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Some schools/boards/division set up additional reasons for some codes. For example,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A - Absent</p>
  <p>F – Field trip</p>
  <p>I – Ill</p>
  <p>I – Ill – Cold</p>
  <p>I – Ill – Headache</p>
  <p>I – Ill – Flu</p>
  <p>I – Ill - Injury</p>
  <p>L – Late</p>
  <p>L – Late – Bus delayed</p>
  <p>L – Late – Missed bus</p>
  <p>M – Medical appointment</p>
  <p>M – Medical appointment – Dentist</p>
  <p>M – Medical appointment - Doctor</p>
  <p>M – Medical appointment - Physiotherapy</p>
  <p>P – Present</p>
  <p>T – Team event</p>
  <p>T – Team event – Volleyball</p>
  <p>T – Team event – Band</p>
  <p>T – Team event - Football</p>
  <p>W – With reason</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Any of the attendance codes (with or without reasons) are available to be assigned to a student. See <a href="att-setup.htm">Setup – Attendance codes</a> for information on setting up attendance codes. Attendance codes for cancelled class and not enrolled do not need to be defined as they are automatically available to be assigned to students where appropriate. See <a href="#Cancelled_class_not_enrolled">Cancelled Class/not enrolled</a> for more information.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Sometimes, the attendance information needs to be summarized in a manner other than based on the A to Z attendance codes entered for the students. For example, you may just want to know how many times the student was absent from school considering all the different codes. Each attendance code has 2 settings that help summarize attendance information.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li>Every code has an official setting that indicates whether it is considered Absent, Present, Late, Suspended, or Grant day (e.g. unexpected school closure).</li>
    <li>Every code also has a classroom setting that indicates whether the student is expected to show up in the classroom. If the student is not expected to show up to the classroom, there are 2 options: absent (student is absent from school) or excused (student is excused from class because they are elsewhere attending a school related activity).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>From the examples above, you can see that there are 3 different ways to view the student’s attendance depending on whether you want to see the school codes, the official codes or the classroom codes.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When a student’s attendance for the entire school year is presented, you can choose between the 3 different views of the attendance codes. Each view will colour code the student’s attendance, providing a legend explaining the colours. The code P – Present is not part of the legend.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Use the Change view icon to select an attendance code view: School codes, Official codes, or Class absent/excused. The Change view icon in the toolbar will represent the current display type.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-4.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:243px;" /></p>
  <p>  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">School codes</span>: This view will show the exact attendance code (A –Z) assigned to the student. Each code assigned to the student will appear in the legend at the bottom, and each code will be assigned a unique colour. Here is an example legend for school codes:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-5.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:549px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Official codes</span>:  Each school attendance code has an equivalent official code to indicate whether the code is considered Present, Absent, Late, Suspended, or Grant day (for unexpected school closures due to weather, infrastructure issues).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-6.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:485px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">Note: in Ontario, suspended students will automatically print as Grant day even if the code is defined as a suspension.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Class absent/excused</span>:  Each school attendance code has an equivalent classroom code to indicate whether the code is considered Present (student is expected to show up to the classroom), Absent (the student is not expected to show up to the classroom because the student is not at school and is not attending a school related activity), or Excused (the student is not expected to show up to the classroom because the student is elsewhere on a school related activity).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This view will provide information that clearly shows how much time the student was not in the classroom.  The sum of class absences and class excused represent the total number of times the student was not in the classroom.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-7.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:202px;" /></p>
  <p>   </p>
  <h3><a name="Unexplained_absence" id="Unexplained_absence"></a>Unexplained absence</h3>
  <p>If a student’s attendance is recorded as Absent (e.g. no specific attendance code was entered), it is considered an unexplained absence.  Depending on the age of the student and the school’s attendance practices, these students are listed for quick follow up. See <a href="att-call-absent-stu.htm">Call home</a> for more information.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Some schools actively follow up with students to determine the reason for the absence, changing the attendance code from absent to a truant code when the student has no valid reason for missing school.</p>
  <h3><a name="Entering_attendance" id="Entering_attendance"></a>Entering attendance</h3>
  <p>The bulk of attendance entries is based on the attendance that is taken in the classroom for a group of students in a homeroom or class. The teachers record this attendance directly into edsembli CONNECT from the classrooms where possible, otherwise, the attendance information is recorded on paper for office staff to enter.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The office typically enters attendance on an individual student basis as attendance information becomes available from phone calls, notes, and students who show up at the school office when arriving late to school.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The school office can enter attendance for groups of students with known attendance such as field trips, sport teams, and bus delays. Excursion groups may be created to record unique groups of students (e.g. girls volleyball team, junior band, football team) so that attendance may be quickly assigned to the students in the excursion group. In addition to excursion groups, attendance may be entered for these other groups: all students, students in a homeroom, students in a grade, students in a class, students with a specific defined character, and students on a bus.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Therefore, attendance may be entered using any one of the following 4 ways, corresponding to the 4 cards in the Enter attendance menu used by the office:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Teachers typically only have access to homeroom and class attendance entry, if they are assigned as the teacher to a homeroom or class. When a teacher accesses class or homeroom attendance, any previously entered attendance will appear (e.g. if the office entered information earlier in the day). If a teacher notices a large number of absences for a class later in the day, they can change their lesson plans based on this information.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">Note: School office staff have the ability to lock the attendance information they entered so that a teacher cannot change it. Although this should not be necessary, the feature is available if required.</p>
  <h3><a name="Attendance_taken_not_taken" id="Attendance_taken_not_taken"></a>Attendance taken/not taken</h3>
  <p>Attendance is typically taken in the classroom for the students in a homeroom or a class. Whether the classroom attendance is entered from the classroom by the teacher, or is entered by the office, the application tracks whether or not the attendance was taken.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Each new day will automatically consider the classroom attendance as ‘not taken’ and the following icon will appear for that class/homeroom (in the toolbar of the attendance entry form):</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-7-1.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:32px;" /> Attendance for the class or homeroom is not yet taken.</p>
  <p>As soon as attendance is entered for a student in the class/homeroom, the attendance will be considered ‘taken’ and the following icon will appear for that class/homeroom:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-7-2.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:32px;" /> Attendance for the class or homeroom has been taken.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If a classroom has all students attending school (e.g. everyone is present), we recommend that the teacher select the ‘not taken’ icon to change it to ‘taken’. By doing this, the office will know that the attendance has been taken. Here is an example of the icon in the toolbar when taking class/homeroom attendance:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-8.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:652px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>From the applications where the office can enter attendance by homeroom or class, they can see whether or not the attendance has been taken in the classroom by looking at the yes/no value in the Entered column as shown here:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-9.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:692px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The office has the ability to show or hide the classes that have already had attendance taken. One of the following 2 icons will appear in the toolbar to indicate whether or not the list shows or hides those classes/homerooms that have already had attendance entered. Select the icon to change to the other icon.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-9-1.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:32px;" /> list does not include classes/homerooms that have attendance taken</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-9-2.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:32px;" />list includes classes/homerooms that have attendance taken</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If the attendance is not yet taken, the office can remind the teachers, if necessary, to complete their attendance so that the office can start tracking down the students with unexplained attendance.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Special note to schools where attendance is entered by homeroom:</span> Once homeroom attendance is taken at the start of the day, the attendance is considered taken for the day. If your school repeats the homeroom attendance process later in the day, the office can select the reset attendance icon before teachers commence the next round of attendance entries. It will set all homerooms back to ‘not taken’.

  <h4><a name="Attendance_notes" id="Attendance_notes"></a>Attendance notes</h4>
  <p>In addition to recording attendance, attendance notes may be recorded each day noting additional information such as sign in/out times, and phone call conversations while attempting to find out more information about an unexplained absence. Attendance notes appear on all attendance entry forms, and they may be accessed in the Notes and Attendance areas of a student’s record.</p>
  <h3><a name="Attendance_info_in_student_records" id="Attendance_info_in_student_records"></a>Attendance info in student records</h3>
  <p>All attendance information recorded for each student is accessible from the Attendance menu in the student’s record.</p>
  <h3><a name="Unexpected_school_closure" id="Unexpected_school_closure"></a>Unexpected school closure (e.g. weather)</h3>
  <p>If an unexpected school closure happens at the start of the day and all students in the school are affected, the school’s calendar may be edited to change the date from a normal school day to a non-school day. We suggest the changing the day type to a Grant day (sometimes referred to as “G” day or General day). To do this, go to Setup, Calendar. Select the date and then edit the date to access the day type field.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If an unexpected school closure affects only some students or affects only part of the school day, do not change the calendar. Instead, use the Group/Excursion attendance entry method to assign the appropriate attendance code to the affected students and time period affected.</p>
  <h3><a name="Holy_day" id="Holy_day"></a>Holy day (religious holiday)  </h3>
  <p>If your school has students that miss regular school days due to religious holidays, be sure to create an attendance code that will accurately reflect how these days are to be reported in your province. Typically, the attendance code is set up as Absent for the official setting, while the Class absent/excused setting can be anything. Ontario schools have specific regulations that require these absences to appear as General (‘G’ day), and therefore they should be set up as Grant for the official setting.</p>
  <h3><a name="Cancelled_class_not_enrolled" id="Cancelled_class_not_enrolled"></a>Cancelled class/not enrolled</h3>
  <p>When entering a student’s attendance, in addition to the attendance codes and reasons available to the school, you may notice the following additional attendance entries:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">c- Cancelled class</span>: This code may be used in the ‘by period’ attendance method to indicate that the  class was cancelled. The code will be treated the same as P – Present, and will therefore only appear on views where the school attendance codes are displayed. It will be treated as present when viewing attendance using the official or class absent/excused code definitions.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">^  - Not enrolled</span>: The student is not enrolled at this school. This code may be used when a student has certain days when they do not attend this school (e.g. a full time student goes to another school every Wednesday for an alternate program). This code will appear as * when viewing the attendance using school attendance codes, N when viewing the official codes (N = Non instructional day). <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: using this code will reduce the number of possible times that a student could attend the class or am/pm time period.</span></p>
  <h3><a name="Sign_in_sign_out" id="Sign_in_sign_out"></a>Sign in/sign out</h3>
  <p>When students arrive late to school, or leave the school early, most schools require the student to go to the office to sign in or sign out so that the office is aware of the student’s attendance.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For students with the morning/afternoon method of attendance, the student’s attendance should be edited to reflect what is happening with the student. If your school uses the morning/afternoon method only, you may skip the rest of this section.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For students with the ‘by period’ method of attendance, the student’s attendance includes sign in and sign out options for each period as shown here:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-10.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:663px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The exact time the office signs a student in or out can be automatically added to today’s attendance note if the check box “Apply sign in/out information to the note” is checked. This setting will be retained for all students until it is unchecked. Here are examples of the notes that will appear when this setting is checked and the office checks the Out box for period 2 and the In box for period 5:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Signed out:  10:09 AM (Period 2 )</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Signed in:  2:12 PM (Period 5)</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sign in</span>: When a student is absent  from school, and then returns back to school, the student may be signed in by checking the box under the ‘In’ column for the appropriate period.  If a student signs in for period 2, they are expected to go to their period 2 class.  The student’s attendance will change to present for period 2 and all subsequent periods, however, if the teacher has already recorded attendance for the class, that attendance will not change automatically but can be edited if appropriate.  For example, if a school records sign in at the end of the day, if a student signed in for period 2 but did not go to their period 3 class, it will detect that the teacher recorded the student as absent and will not overwrite this attendance.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sign out</span>: When the student is attending school but needs to leave the school early, he/she may be signed out by checking the box under the ‘Out’ column for the appropriate period. If a student signs out for period 3, he/she is not expected to go to their period 3 class. If you want a student to be considered present for period 3 because part of the class was attended, check the sign out box for period 4 (the first period in which the student will be missing for the whole class). Using the period 3 sign out as an example, the office should change the period 3 attendance from Absent to a code that represents the reason the student is leaving school. This new code will appear for all subsequent periods automatically, however, if the teacher has already recorded attendance for the class, the attendance will not change automatically but can be edited if appropriate.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="font-style: normal;">If a student signs in and out (or vice versa) in the same period, the 2 actions will cancel each other out (both boxes cannot be checked). Recording the sign in/out in the notes will provide details outlining the student’s activities for that period.</p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">Note: the sign/in out functionality on the list view (for smaller devices) looks like this:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-11.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:355px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> The sign in/out icon will represent the current state of the student for this period. One of the following 3 icons will appear:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>  <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-11-2.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:32px;" />Student has no sign in/out entry for this period</p>
  <p>  <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-11-3.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:32px;" />Student is currently signed out for this period.</p>
  <p>  <img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-11-1.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:32px;" />Student has signed in for this period.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Click the icon that appears for the student to change the sign in/out state.</p>
  <h3><a name="Notifications" id="Notifications"></a>Notifications</h3>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">This section applies to the ‘by period’ attendance method only. This feature is planned for a future release.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Sometimes notifications are created to ensure that student attendance accurately reflects what happened in the classroom. When a student signs in to the office, the office will assume that the student attends class and the attendance reflects this assumption.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If the sign in occurs after the teacher has taken attendance, the teacher will automatically have a new notification created to ensure that the student actually went to class after signing in. The teacher will need to confirm the student’s attendance at some point (later in the day or the next day) to clear the notification. Here is the notification that the teacher will see:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/att-ic-12.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:671px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As soon as the teacher selects one of the options for the notification, it will be removed from the teacher’s list of notifications. If the teacher selects the STUDENT DID NOT SHOW UP, the student’s attendance for that class will change to Absent (unexplained absence) and the student will appear in the list of students with an unexplained absence.</p>
