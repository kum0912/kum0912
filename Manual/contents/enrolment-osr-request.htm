<p> </p>
<p>Most schools have an official record for each student enrolled in their 
 school. This is typically a file folder containing paper copies of pertinent 
 data for the student. The official record will have a province-specific 
 name (e.g. Ontario Student Record (OSR), Cumulative Folder, Personal Student 
 Record).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Schools can track requests for a student’s official record from another 
 school, as well as track requests to send the official record to another 
 school (e.g. if the student is leaving your school). As well, the 
 official record identifies which school is the record holder. Information 
 is available for current, past and future students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Official record information is school-specific, and may be changed to 
 reflect the student’s activity at this school. Any school-specific data 
 changes will not impact the student’s information at another school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Choose Enrolment &gt; OSR request from the submenu.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2><a name="OSR_request" id="OSR_request"></a>OSR request</h2>
<p>The OSR request card contains an indicator as to whether or not the 
 student’s Official Student Record (OSR) is located at this school.  It 
 also contains date fields that the school may use to track the movement 
 of the OSR to and from other schools, and the name of the school where 
 the OSR was sent (if applicable).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following fields are available when editing the OSR request card. 
  This information is optional and is recorded for information purposes 
 only (except in Saskatchewan where the first field (OSR at this school) 
 is reported as part of the provincial data collection).</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Official Student Record (OSR) at School Name: 
 This switch  is set to Yes if the student’s OSR is located at this 
 school.  This school’s name will appear in the field name.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<ol style="list-style: disc;">
	<li style="list-style: none; display: inline; margin-left: -20px;"><ul style="list-style: disc;">

<p>If the student is enrolled in more than 1 school in that school year, 
 then you will see a Schools drop-down list as shown here:</p>
