<h2>Attendance reports: Common features</h2>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>The attendance applications share many common features. Attendance 
 information is typically presented in “cards” and the same cards are found 
 throughout the attendance options. We recommend that you familiarize yourself 
 with these.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When accessing attendance reports, some reports will condense the attendance 
 information so that you can see the attendance in a meaningful, easy to 
 read format. This section will explain how the attendance recorded 
 for a student is abbreviated on some reports.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example monthly attendance report showing attendance:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:779px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Abbreviation of AM/PM attendance codes</h3>
<p>In order to make the report easy to read, the student’s AM/PM attendance 
 is displayed as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">. Present for the day</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A Absent for the day (morning and afternoon)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A/ Absent for the morning only</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">/A Absent for the afternoon only</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">AL Absent for the morning, late for the afternoon</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Students attending only the morning or only the afternoon will be represented 
 with just one code.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Students with the ‘by period’ attendance method can have many different 
 attendance codes entered for a single day, making it unrealistic to present 
 that detailed information on some reports. Sometimes, the period 
 attendance is reported in the morning/afternoon format. <a href="#By_period">See 
 ‘By period’ attendance method – conversion to AM/PM</a>.</p>
<h3>Non-school days</h3>
<p>Non-school days defined in the school’s calendar will appear as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">pa Special Day (e.g. professional activity 
 day)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">gr Grant Day or General Absence Day in Ontario 
 (e.g. unexpected school closure)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">h Holiday (e.g. Statutory holiday)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">b Board Day (e.g. holiday designated by the 
 board/division)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a student has no classes on a regular school day, no attendance is 
 recorded. This may be part-time student who are not scheduled for classes 
 on certain days in their timetable, or half-time students who attend school 
 on alternate days. Those days will appear like this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;">n or N Non-Instructional 
 Day (student is not scheduled for instruction)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other codes you may notice:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">* Student is not enrolled in the school yet</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">_ Future date</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Ontario schools please see Notes for Ontario 
 schools regarding the use of the * code</p>
<h3>Attendance codes</h3>
<p>Some reports may give the option to use either the school defined attendance 
 codes or the official attendance codes as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:301px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">School codes<span style="font-weight: normal;">: 
 This will show the exact attendance code (A –Z) assigned to the student.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Official code</span>s: This will 
 show official codes only (e.g. S – Sick recorded for a student will show 
 as A – Absent). Each school attendance code has an equivalent official 
 code to indicate whether the code is considered Present, Absent, Late, 
 Suspended, or Grant day (for unexpected school closures due to weather, 
 infrastructure issues).</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: By period students may not have this 
 option available if the report is converting the attendance to AM/PM as 
 explained in ‘By period’ attendance method – conversion to AM/PM.</p>
<h3>Report parameters</h3>
<p>Depending upon the attendance report, a Report parameters card typically 
 appears to provide some options on how the report will look.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here’s an example of the report parameters for a monthly attendance 
 report. The month can be selected and a Legend may or may not be included.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:301px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="Legends" id="Legends"></a>Legends</h3>
<p>Legends help identify the letters and symbols (as explained above), 
 as well as the attendance codes that may appear on the report. Here is 
 an example of a legend that appears at the end of a report that was generated 
 using school codes:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:769px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an example of a legend that appears when the official codes 
 are on the report rather than the school codes:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/att-rep5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:769px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Grant Day code may appear as a lower case ‘g’ when the date is a 
 grant day in the calendar, and as an upper case ‘G’ when the student is 
 given an attendance code that is officially defined as a grant day. Grant 
 day will appear as General Absence Day (Grant) in the legend for Ontario 
 schools.</p>
<h3><a name="By_period" id="By_period"></a>‘By period’ attendance method 
 – conversion to AM/PM</h3>
<p>Students whose attendance is recorded for each period may have their 
 attendance converted to AM/PM attendance for some reports. For example, 
 if M = Medical, F = Field trip, T = team sport event, L = Late, and P 
 = Present, and the student has 8 periods in the day, here’s an example 
 of what the attendance might look like for the 8 periods:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;">MPFF PPLT</p>
<p>This type of detailed period information report is difficult to print 
 in limited space so the above example, would be converted to L/P (late 
 to school in morning because of the medical appointment, and Present for 
 the afternoon). The resulting AM/PM attendance will only use the official 
 codes, and therefore, the option to print school attendance codes is not 
 available for those with the ‘by period’ method.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is done by considering the ‘first afternoon period’ defined in 
 the setup of the school’s attendance parameters. If a school has 
 4 periods, and the first afternoon period is set to period 3, here are 
 some examples of how the attendance is converted to morning/afternoon 
 (A = absent, P = present, L = late and AA AA represent A in period 1, 
 A in period 2, A in period 3 and A in period 4):</p>
<p> </p>
<table style="border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" cellspacing="0" width="100%" border="1">
	<colgroup><col style="width: 33.333%;"/>
	<col style="width: 33.333%;"/>
	<col style="width: 33.333%;"/>
	</colgroup><tbody><tr>

		 in periods 1 to 4</span></td>

<h3>Notes for Ontario schools</h3>
<p>The following information pertains to Ontario schools only. Schools 
 and boards should be familiar with the official Ministry enrolment register 
 instructions for elementary and secondary schools that are updated annually 
 on the Ministry’s site<a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html"> 
 http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/forms.html</a>.</p>
<h4>Supervised Alternative Learning (SAL)</h4>
<p>The Ministry’s instructions state: <span style="font-style: italic;">For 
 pupils who are participants in a SAL program, record their attendance 
 in the Daily Attendance Record with “G” for the period when they are participating 
 in the non-academic components of the SAL program.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In edsembli SIS, the student’s attendance type (in the student&#39;s record 
 in <a href="../students/enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 &gt; Enrolment register info</a>) must be set to SAL. SAL students have 
 one of the following SAL attendance types that determine how the student 
 is reported:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Less than 70 minutes of day school 
	 instruction: These students will see a ‘g’ (General absence day) on 
	 the report.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-left: 40px;">More than or equal to 70 minutes 
	 of day school instruction: These students will see a ‘g’ (General 
	 Absence Day) for half the day, and the attendance entered for the 
	 classes in the student’s timetable will be reported for the other 
	 half of the day (as per ‘<a href="#By_period">By period’ attendance 
	 method – conversion to AM/PM</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Admission of a pupil to the register</h4>
<p>If a student is absent at the start of the school year, the Ministry 
 requires * (not enrolled) until the first time the student shows up to 
 school. The Ministry’s instructions state:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Enter a pupil’s name on the register on 
 the day on which the pupil actually begins to attend classes for the current 
 school year. Although pupils’ names from the previous school year may 
 be stored in a school’s computerized system for administrative purposes, 
 a pupil’s name must not be entered into the current register until the 
 pupil actually begins to attend classes. Exceptions to this requirement 
 are the following pupils, whose names may be entered on the register on 
 the first day of school for the current school year:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>A pupil who is continuing in a <a href="../students/enrolment-sal.htm">Supervised 
	 Alternative Learning (SAL)</a> program from the previous school year 
	 with the formal approval of the board’s SAL Committee.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In edsembli SIS, if a student’s attendance type is SAL, the student 
 is admitted to the register on the first day of school.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>A pupil who is continuing to receive home instruction.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In edsembli SIS, schools are expected to record the attendance of a 
 secondary pupil who is receiving home instructions as if he or she were 
 attending classes at the school. Should the student remain on the register 
 from one school year to the next, and if the student were absent on the 
 first day of school, the school can indicate they have had contact with 
 the student as explained next.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>A pupil who was referred to an attendance counsellor in the previous 
	 school year and whose file is still active.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In edsembli SIS, if the student’s contact note on the first day of school 
 has Yes indicated in the ‘Contact with pupil’ field, the student is considered 
 enrolled, and therefore the student&#39;s attendance register will reflect 
 the student’s actual attendance (e.g. A rather than *).</p>
