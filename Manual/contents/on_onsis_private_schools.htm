<h1><a name="Private_schools_" id="Private_schools_"></a>Private schools</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>All private schools are required to provide statistical information 
 to the ministry regarding student enrolment, staff, courses of study and 
 (for inspected secondary schools) credits granted and diplomas issued. 
 This information is collected in the Ministry’s OnSIS application, and 
 the edsembli SIS can assist with the collection of this data.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Aggregate_vs_elemental_data_" id="Aggregate_vs_elemental_data_"></a>Aggregate 
 vs elemental data</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Two types of data are collected by OnSIS:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aggregate data</span> is a summary 
 of information by category. For example, the number of children in each 
 grade, by age or by gender. Specific, identifying information for each 
 child is not collected. Aggregate data is collected for students who cannot 
 be issued Ministry Ontario Education Numbers (OENs). This includes all 
 private elementary students and students attending non-inspected private 
 secondary schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Elemental data</span> is more specific 
 and includes information with respect to individual students, educators 
 or classes. In most cases, the elemental data collected from private schools 
 is the same as that collected from publicly-funded schools. Elemental 
 data is collected for all students attending inspected private secondary 
 schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Configuring_your_private_school_" id="Configuring_your_private_school_"></a>Configuring 
 your private school</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Every private school should be configured properly so that it identified 
 as a private school. Secondary private schools can be configured so that 
 they are flagged as an inspected secondary school, and if appropriate, 
 identified as a private secondary school that has elementary students 
 as well.  Use Setup &gt; School &gt; <a href="../setup/school-configure.htm">Configuration</a> 
 to configure the school to ensure that the correct options appear for 
 the school.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Including_excluding_students_" id="Including_excluding_students_"></a>Including/excluding 
 students</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>If the school has both elementary and secondary students, make sure 
 the student’s entry date to secondary school has the correct date. If 
 the entry to secondary school date is after the count date (e.g. a future 
 date), the student is considered an elementary student and will be excluded 
 from the secondary OnSIS reports.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Similarly, if an elementary student has a future entry date to elementary 
 school, the student is excluded from the OnSIS reporting (OnSIS will allow 
 students under age 4 as of December 31 so this field may be used to exclude 
 these students).   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Elementary schools may also exclude students in specific grades if easier 
 than setting the entry date to elementary school (e.g. students in grade 
 N (Nursery) can be omitted when creating the aggregate reports).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sometimes schools create a student board resident status with a ministry 
 code of 00, and students assigned this status will be omitted (e.g. foreign 
 exchange students not on the register). These students are excluded from 
 all Ministry reports, not just OnSIS.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Educators_must_be_updated_in_OnSIS_" id="Educators_must_be_updated_in_OnSIS_"></a>Educators 
 must be updated in OnSIS</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>When creating batch files that include the teacher of the class, the 
 teacher’s MEN# in the SIS is used to identify the teacher in the file. 
 Every educator in the SIS must have a MEN# in their staff record. OnSIS 
 also requires the teacher’s position code in the batch file, and this 
 code must match the code in OnSIS.  By updating the educators in 
 OnSIS before getting extracts, the SIS can use the matching position code 
 found in the extract. See <a href="on-update-educators-onsis.htm">Update 
 educators in OnSIS</a> for more info.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Get_extract_files_from_OnSIS_before_submitting_batch_files_" id="Get_extract_files_from_OnSIS_before_submitting_batch_files_"></a>Get 
 extract files from OnSIS before submitting batch files</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Before creating any batch files in the SIS, extract files need to be 
 created in the Ministry’s OnSIS application, and these files need to be 
 saved in edsembli’s file manager. Extracts are used to determine whether 
 to send an add or update instruction in the batch file created by the 
 SIS.  See <a href="on-get-extracts-onsis.htm">Get extracts from OnSIS</a> 
 for more info.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Updating_data_in_OnSIS_using_the__Create_Upload_Process__cycle_" id="Updating_data_in_OnSIS_using_the__Create_Upload_Process__cycle_"></a>Updating 
 data in OnSIS using the ‘Create/Upload/Process’ cycle</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Data in OnSIS is updated through the process of creating batch files 
 in the SIS, uploading those batch files to OnSIS, and then processing 
 the results generated by OnSIS (analyzing the errors/warnings). These 
 3 basic steps are repeated until all the data is submitted and is accurate. 
 Since files need to be transferred between the SIS and OnSIS, the steps 
 may seem a little more complicated until you are comfortable uploading 
 and downloading files. See the OnSIS <a href="on-onsis-important-concepts.htm">Important 
 concepts</a> section for info on <a href="on-onsis-important-concepts.htm">Updating 
 data in OnSIS using the ‘Create/Upload/Process’ cycle</a>. Depending on 
 the size of the school and complexity of the data, some private elementary 
 schools may opt to enter the aggregate data directly into OnSIS instead 
 of following these steps.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Sign-off_in_OnSIS_" id="Sign-off_in_OnSIS_"></a>Sign-off in 
 OnSIS</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>After all the data has been updated in OnSIS, all the errors and warnings 
 have been addressed to the best of your knowledge, you must log into OnSIS 
 and start the OnSIS sign-off process for the submission period.  For 
 more information on the sign-off process in OnSIS, see <a href="on-sign-off-OnSIS.htm">Sign-off 
 in OnSIS</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="Private_elementary_schools__" id="Private_elementary_schools__"></a>Private 
 elementary schools  </h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Private elementary students are not issued OENs from the Ministry of 
 Education, and therefore, OnSIS is only able to collect aggregate student 
 data (e.g. totals of students rather than specific student names and information). 
  The data is collected once a year, on October 31st.   </p>
<p>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The enrolment/transfers/retirements/admissions statistics are generally 
 based on the students’ enrolment information from November 1 of the previous 
 year, until October 31st of the current academic year.  Therefore, 
 past students are considered. Educator class and subject assignment information 
 is collected on all 3 count dates: October 31, March 31 and June 30. If 
 the elementary school is combined with the private inspected secondary 
 school, all educator data is reported via the secondary school submissions. 
  If the elementary private school is not combined with the inspected 
 secondary school, the elementary school must submit educator data on all 
 3 count dates.</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Elementary private schools will have their own submission period called 
 October private elementary school. If needed, the private elementary school 
 will also have the submission periods called March private elementary 
 school and June private elementary schools.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This chart summarizes the OnSIS batch files required for elementary 
 private schools:</p>

<p>* When the October submission period is opened, the &#39;Enrolment, Transfers, 
 Retirements and Admissions&#39; section on the OnSIS website will be pre-populated 
 with the enrolment at the end of the previous year.  This number 
 cannot be changed as it represents the elementary enrolment on October 
 31 of the previous year).  The batch file is sending the transfers, 
 retirements and admissions since November 1 last year until October 31 
 of this year.  Last year&#39;s number, minus the transfers and retirements, 
 plus the admissions, will mathematically determine the enrolment on October 
 31 of this year. E.g. Enrolment October 31 last year - transfers - retirements 
 + admissions = enrolment October 31 this year.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fortunately, if the school is configured properly, only the submission 
 periods and options that apply to the school will appear in the SIS. Use 
 the cards to guide you through the private elementary school submission 
 period (or periods as explained above).  Below is an example of a 
 private elementary school that is not combined with an inspected private 
 secondary school, and therefore the Educator assignment info card is available 
 (to generate the educator class and subject batch files).   </p>

<p> </p>
<p>At this time, all private secondary schools using the edsembli SIS are 
 inspected. Non-inspected private secondary schools will operate just like 
 private elementary schools that are not combined with an inspected secondary 
 school (e.g. aggregate info in October, and education class and subject 
 assignment info in October, March and June).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Inspected private secondary schools will report data to OnSIS just like 
 Ontario publicly funded secondary schools; however, there are some programs 
 that don’t apply to private schools and therefore the corresponding batch 
 files do not apply.  Inspected private secondary schools <span style="font-weight: bold;">do 
 not report</span> the following info:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Supervised Alternative Learning (SAL)</li>
	<li>Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) program &amp; certifications</li>
	<li>Special education  </li>
	<li>Course calendar and student option sheets (March)</li>
	<li>Suspension/expulsion info</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Inspected private secondary schools, combined with an elementary private 
 school, will have the option to submit the educator subject assignment 
 batch file, which does not apply to regular secondary schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Inspected private secondary schools will see the same submission periods 
 as publicly funded secondary schools; however, the batch file options 
 that don’t apply will be removed. The OnSIS menu will contain 3 submission 
 periods:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>October secondary school</li>
	<li>March secondary school</li>
	<li>June secondary school</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Fortunately, if the school is configured properly, only the submission 
 periods and options that apply to the school will appear in the SIS. Use 
 the cards to guide you through the submission periods. Below is an example 
 of the October submission period for a private secondary school.</p>
