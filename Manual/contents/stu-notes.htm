<h1>Student records &gt; Notes</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h3><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>
<p>The Notes menu option in a student’s record is an easy way for you to 
 record and view student-related observations/activities. Notes are available 
 for current, past and future students and access to each is controlled 
 through security. Notes are retained from year to year, however, tools 
 are available to discard bulk notes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some notes are student-specific, which means the information is the 
 same regardless of the school that the student attends. Only the school 
 that is considered the edsembli record owner can edit these notes:  Medical 
 notes, Special education notes and Alternate programs notes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All other note areas are school specific, meaning these notes are unique 
 for each school and may be edited regardless of whether or not the school 
 is the edsembli record owner. These notes include Notepads 1/2/3, Attendance 
 notes and the &#39;Dated notepad&#39;. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Notepad 1, 2, and 3 are the default notepad names but the board or school 
 can change/customize to better reflect the purpose of the notepad (e.g. 
 Principal, Secretary, and Guidance). The dated notepad title is user definable 
 as well (e.g. Discipline). See <a href="../setup/setup-notepad-titles.htm">Setup 
 &gt; User-defined fields &gt; Notepad titles</a> for details on how these 
 are set up. The board/division/district may set these up for selected 
 schools, and if they are not setup centrally, the school may set them 
 up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The notepads with user defined titles (Notepads 1/2/3 and the Dated 
 notepad) will not be shared with other schools, however, they may be accessed 
 only by those with security rights through the board/division/district.</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>The Notes submenu options shown below will be unique to each school 
 and student. Only special education students have access to the special 
 education notes. Alternate program notes are only available to those students 
 who are flagged as having an alternate program in the Enrolment &gt; Student 
 enrolment area. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Using the Attendance notes example below, you can use the tab strip 
 to navigate between notes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student’s record exists in other schools, use the drop down arrow 
 to select a different school. The notes with user defined titles are not 
 visible when looking at another school. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/notepad2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:971px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 3 user-defined notepads (Notepad 1, 2 &amp; 3) are memo style note 
 areas that have no character limitations. If a note exits, select the 
 note (row click) to edit it. If no note exists, use the Add icon in the 
 tool bar to add the note for the very first time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/notepad3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:959px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Attendance, Medical, Special education, Alternate programs and Discipline 
 notes are dated notes and you can only record one note for each date. 
 If another note is added on the same date, the new note will be appended 
 to the end of the original note. Use the Add button to add a dated note, 
 or select an existing note (row click) to access the Edit option. The 
 delete icon is available on the tool bar in the edit form.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>One user-defined notepad (called the &#39;dated notepad&#39; during the setup) 
 has 2 additional fields when adding the note.  The user can optionally 
 select from the 2 user-defined list fields that have user-defined titles 
 and values in the drop down list. If the notepad were called Discipline 
 notes, the user could call the 2 fields &#39;Infraction&#39; and &#39;Consequence&#39;. 
 This would allow the school to record a discipline note and it will allow 
 the user to select a single infraction and a single consequence for each 
 discipline note. </p>
