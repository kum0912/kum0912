<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>The Class info option in a student’s record contains information related 
 to the courses, classes and teachers involved in the student’s education 
 during the current school year (this year) or the upcoming school year 
 (next year).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Past students do not have access to the Class info menu, however their 
 historical class information, if applicable, is available in student record 
 options Achievement &gt;  Completed 
 courses or <a href="prev-years-marks-comments.htm">Previous years 
 &gt; Marks &amp; Comments</a> or <a href="prev-years-att-details.htm">Previous 
 years &gt; Attendance details</a>. Past students have a grade last attended 
 which is editable by selecting that field on the profile area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Choose Class info &gt; Classes. This option provides a single location 
 where you can see all the classes in which the student is enrolled in 
 either this year or next year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:263px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A page will appear on the right that shows you cards for This Year and 
 Next year.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="This_Year_vs_Next_Year" id="This_Year_vs_Next_Year"></a>This 
 Year vs Next Year tabs</h3>
<p>As shown below, a tab strip will appear with up to 2 options:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:205px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>THIS YEAR tab will appear if the student is enrolled in ANY school in 
 the board/division/district during the current school year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>NEXT YEAR will appear if the student will be enrolled in ANY school 
 in the board/division/district in the upcoming school year. The student’s 
 School year status at each school determines whether or not a student 
 is considered as attending that school for this year and/or next year. 
 The school year status field is found in the<a href="enrolment-students.htm"> 
 Enrolment &gt; Student enrolment</a> option on the School enrolment card. 
 These are the School year statuses you&#39;ll see:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li style="margin-left: -20px;"><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">This year and next year</span>: student 
	 is considered as enrolled in the school on the THIS YEAR and the NEXT 
	 YEAR tabs.</p></li>
	<li style="margin-left: -20px;"><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">This year only</span>: student is considered 
	 as enrolled in the school on the THIS YEAR tab.</p></li>
	<li style="margin-left: -20px;"><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Next year only</span>: student is considered 
	 as enrolled in the school on the NEXT YEAR tab.</p></li>
	<li style="margin-left: -20px;"><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Withdrawn</span>: although the student 
	 is no longer enrolled in the school, the THIS YEAR tab is available 
	 to see the classes that were completed or dropped, and the student’s 
	 grade info just prior to leaving the school.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p <p="">Use the tab strip to navigate between the student’s classes for 
 this year or next year. When both options exist for the student, it will 
 default THIS YEAR.</p>
<h3><a name="Students_concurrently_enrolled_in_more_than_1_school" id="Students_concurrently_enrolled_in_more_than_1_school"></a>Students 
 concurrently enrolled (more than 1 school)</h3>
<p>For the selected school year (this or next), if the student is enrolled 
 in more than 1 school in that school year, then the select schools drop-down 
 will appear as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes3.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:512px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>It will default “All schools” to provide the most accurate picture of 
 the student’s classes and workload because the student is attending multiple 
 schools concurrently (at the same time).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to the “All schools” option, the drop-down list will also 
 include the individual school names where the student is/has/will be enrolled 
 in for the selected school year. Select an individual school to show the 
 classes considering only the selected school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Classes option includes these cards:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li style="font-weight: normal;"><span><a href="#Current_location">Current 
	 location</a></span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: normal;"><span><a href="#Grade_info">Grade 
	 info</a>: (Another card will appear for the grade info for other schools, 
	 if applicable.)</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: normal;"><span><a href="#Course_workload">Course 
	 workload</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<h2><a name="Current_location" id="Current_location"></a>Current location</h2>
<p>The current location card provides the student’s current location right 
 now. It will use today’s timetable to determine where the student is located. The 
 current computer time will be compared to the school’s period times to 
 determine the current period. Each period in the school’s setup will be 
 available from a tab strip. The current period will be defaulted, showing 
 the start and end times of the period (e.g. Period 1 (8:15 AM - 9:34 AM).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student’s timetable contains at least one class in a period today, 
 the Current location card is available to indicate where the student may 
 be located right now by showing the class, room and teacher information 
 for the student’s class during the current period (based on the current 
 time compared to the school’s period times). If the student is not assigned 
 a class in the current period, the words “Student is not in any class 
 at this time” will appear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the selected period, you will see the class code, title of the course, 
 room, teacher(s) and school information so you can locate the student 
 easily, as shown in the example below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:678px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student is taking a class at another school, the background will 
 be shaded as shown in this example:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:847px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the other school’s periods extend before or after this school’s period 
 times, the tab strip will include ‘Other’ if the student is taking classes 
 in these other times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the current time does not correspond to any specific period, the 
 next available period will be the default (or period 1 if outside of the 
 school day). Use the tab strip to navigate to other periods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student does not have any classes today (based on the school’s 
 calendar date), the Current location card will be not be available. Only 
 classes scheduled into actual periods will be considered (period X or 
 floater classes are excluded).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This card is only available if the student is attending school in the 
 current school year, so it will be available only when accessing the THIS 
 YEAR tab.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Grade_info" id="Grade_info"></a>Grade info</h2>
<p>A Grade info card will appear for this school to show the student’s 
 grade at the school, the homeroom designation/number/teacher (if applicable), 
 advisor group designation/number/teacher (if applicable), attendance type 
 (full time, part time, etc), and attendance method. Grade info exists 
 for this year and/or next year (e.g. the student can have a grade for 
 this year which is distinct from the grade for next year, as well as distinct 
 homerooms, and distinct advisor groups). Attendance type is only available 
 for THIS YEAR.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every student will have at least one Grade info card. If the student 
 is enrolled at this school for the selected school year (this or next), 
 the first card will be titled Grade info – This School Name as shown here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes6.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:668px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student is enrolled at another school (or schools) for the selected 
 school year, you&#39;ll see a Grade info – other school(s) card. This information 
 can&#39;t be edited.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes6a.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:369px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">You can edit grade info at this school by 
 selecting the Edit icon on the tool bar of the card. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:619px;" border="0"/></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Grade</span>: 
 The student’s grade at the school. Grade is a mandatory field. Changes 
 to a student’s grade will be automatically recorded as an internal transfer. 
 The internal transfer icon  on the tool bar can be used to view/edit 
 grade internal transfers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Each school has a table of grades that controls 
 the grades available to be assigned to the students in the school. Each 
 grade in the table is a number or a letter (or 2 letters). Letter grades 
 can have a title as well (e.g. letter grade K may have the title Kindergarten). 
 </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Note: the board/division/district is responsible 
 for the set up of grades using <a href="../setup/setup-grades.htm">Setup 
 &gt; Board &gt; Grades</a>. This is also where they define the Ministry 
 equivalent grade if needed (e.g. Alberta schools may have grades J, K, 
 M, E, C, EC, and P which are the equivalent of grade EC as required by 
 the province).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Homeroom</span>: 
 The student’s homeroom number, designation (a 4 digit code assigned by 
 the school), and the homeroom teacher(s). Homeroom is an optional field 
 (“not assigned” will appear if the student is not assigned to a homeroom).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Homerooms are set up by the school using 
 <a href="../setup/setup-class-hmrm.htm">Setup &gt; Class info &gt; Homerooms</a> 
 and tools exist to help automate the assignment of student homerooms for 
 each new school year (Student tools &gt; Homerooms)..</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Changes to a student’s homeroom will be automatically 
 recorded as an internal transfer. The <a href="enrolment-internal-transfers.htm">internal 
 transfer</a> icon on the tool bar can be used to view/edit grade internal 
 transfers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Changes to a student’s homeroom may trigger 
 the automatic reassignment of classes in a student’s timetable, if the 
 homeroom is setup with class associations. This is a feature that many 
 elementary schools enable and is described in the setup of homerooms.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Advisor 
 group</span>: The student’s advisor group name, teacher(s), and room number. 
  Advisor groups are similar to homerooms where a room and teacher(s) 
 is/are assigned to the advisor group. The name of the group can be anything 
 the school wants. Some schools use advisor groups to indicate the guidance 
 counsellor assigned to the student. Some schools have students meet regularly 
 in groups where the students meet with an advisory teacher to discuss 
 general school related topics.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Advisor group is an optional field (“not 
 assigned” will appear if the student is not assigned to an advisor group). 
 They are set up by the school using <a href="../setup/setup-class-advisors.htm">Setup 
 &gt; Class info &gt; Advisors</a> and tools exist to help automate the 
 assignment of student advisors for each new school year (Student tools 
 &gt; Advisors).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Attendance 
 type</span>: A field to indicate the student’s attendance at the school 
 as to whether or not it is full time, part time, independent study, or 
 half time*. Half time types include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Half time 
 AM</span>: Student attends every day but for the morning only.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Half time 
 PM</span>: Student attends every day but for the afternoon only.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Half time 
 alternate days:</span> Student attends both the morning and the afternoon, 
 but does not attend school every day. Students with this attendance type 
 will belong to one of four possible alternate day schedule groups (e.g. 
 Half Time Alt. Days 1, Half Time Alt. Days 2, Half Time Alt. Days 3, or 
 Half Time Alt. Days 4). The school’s <a href="../setup/setup-calendar.htm">calendar</a> 
 is set up to indicate which school days the students with schedule number 
 1 attend, which days the students with schedule number 2 attend, etc. 
 For example, the students with schedule 1 may attend every Monday, Wednesday 
 and alternate Fridays, while the schedule 2 students attend every Tuesday, 
 Thursday, and the opposite Fridays.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: ;">* Half-time is only available 
 for schools offering pre-grade 1 (kindergarten) programs, based on the 
 school’s <a href="../setup/setup-grades.htm">table of grades</a>. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: ;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: ;">Ontario schools only: The 
 attendance type field is also located in the <a href="enrolment_register_information.htm">Enrolment 
 register info</a> option in the student&#39;s record. Refer to this section 
 for additional info about this field. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Attendance 
 method</span>:  A field to indicate how many times a day a student’s 
 daily attendance is recorded. Elementary students typically have morning/afternoon 
 attendance recorded. Secondary students typically have attendance recorded 
 for each period where the student is expected to show up to a class. A 
 school with kindergarten to grade 12 students may have students with either 
 of the 2 possible attendance methods:  Morning/afternoon or By period. 
 The allowable attendance methods for each school is part of the school&#39;s 
 configuration (<a href="../setup/setup-school-configuration.htm">Setup 
 &gt; School &gt; School configuration</a>).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Editing_grades" id="Editing_grades"></a>Editing 
 grades, homerooms and advisor groups for many students</span></h3>
<p>Rather than editing students individually through student records, there 
 are tools that will assist schools when many students require edits to 
 their grades, homerooms, or advisor groups. For example, as the school 
 prepares for a new school year, the students’ next year’s grades are automatically 
 advanced (see Scheduling next year &gt; Prepare for next year &gt; Initialize 
 next year). You can automatically assign homerooms and advisor groups 
 to students using a number of different assignment options provided within 
 the Student tools option.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Course_workload" id="Course_workload"></a>Course 
 workload</span></h2>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The course workload area provides a view 
 of the student’s workload with respect to the courses they are taking 
 this year or next year. If a student has any classes in their timetable, 
 they will have one or more course workload cards. Depending upon the student’s 
 timetable and the time in the school year, course workload cards may exist 
 for the current classes the student is taking, the upcoming classes in 
 the next semester/term, the completed classes, the dropped classes, and 
 the unscheduled classes for next year. Each of these card types are explained 
 in detail further below.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p>A course workload card will appear to provide a quick view of the student’s 
 current course workload as of today’s date in the school’s calendar. Additional 
 cards will appear where applicable to show the student’s upcoming workload 
 (for courses that start in a future term/semester), the course workload 
 that is now completed, and course workload for courses that the student 
 has dropped.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: Course workload information is for 
 informational purposes only. If you need to make timetable changes to 
 the classes, use the student record option <a href="class-info-timetable.htm">Class 
 info &gt; Timetable</a> which presents the student’s classes in a more 
 traditional timetable format along with all the tools to assist in making 
 effective timetable changes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Here is an example workload card for a 
 student’s current classes:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes9.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:905px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each class you&#39;ll see this information:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Class</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> This is the class from the student’s 
 timetable. Class (e.g. MAT9Ab) is a combination of the course code (e.g. 
 MAT9A in all caps) and the section letter which is a lower case letter 
 a to z (e.g. b in this example). In the school’s classes table (e.g. the 
 master timetable), a unique section letter is used for each unique group 
 of students that are taught the course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Title</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The title of the course.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Teacher</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The teacher or teachers assigned 
 to the class.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Room</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The room number where the class 
 is taught. If a class is taught in multiple rooms, where the room changes 
 on different days, the room will appear as M. Select the class to access 
 the details option to see class details including specific room information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Start 
 date</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The start date of 
 the class based on the semester/term assigned to the class. If the class 
 is continuous entry, each student has a start date which is independent 
 from the class start date, in which case you will see the student’s unique 
 start date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">End 
 date</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The end date of the 
 class based on the last day in semester/term assigned to the class. If 
 the class is continuous entry, each student has their own end date which 
 is independent from the class end date, in which case the student’s unique 
 end date is shown. End date appears when the class is completed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #007fff;">Drop 
 date</span>: <span style="font-weight: normal;">If the student dropped 
 (withdrew) from the class prior to completing the class, the dropped date 
 will appear rather than the end date. Dropped dates are recorded automatically 
 when a class is removed from a student’s timetable. Dropped dates are 
 also automatically recorded as the student’s exit/retirement date when 
 a student’s Maplewood status changes to withdrawn.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Semester(s)</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The semester(s) in which this 
 class is taught. This field will be hidden if the school does not offer 
 semesters, or if the student is only taking classes that are scheduled 
 for the full year.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Term(s)</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The term(s) in which this class 
 is taught. This field will be hidden if the school does not split semesters 
 into terms, or if the student is only taking classes that are scheduled 
 for all terms. For example, if school has 2 semesters and 2 terms, some 
 classes may be offered in semester 1, term 1 and other classes in semester 
 1, term 2. If a student is not taking any of the single term classes, 
 the term column will be hidden.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">School</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The school in which this class 
 is taught. This is beneficial if a student is taking classes in more than 
 1 school, since the workload cards consider other schools as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each class on the workload card may be selected to see more details 
 about the class (e.g. info about the <a href="../setup/setup-class-classes.htm">class 
 setup</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="Flex" id="Flex"></a>Flex, CTS, and continuous entry classes)</h3>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">Some classes may include an icon to provide 
 a visual indication that the class may be one of these unique class types. 
 The icons, explained below, will provide a tool tip when the icon is hovered, 
 and may provide additional functionality when the icon is selected as 
 described here:</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><img src="assets/images/flex-icon.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:32px;" border="0"/><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Flex class (Alberta only)</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The class is considered a flex 
 class, which is a unique class type available for those schools offering 
 flex periods. The flex class is scheduled into the student’s timetable 
 and typically all students have the same flex period. Students can pick 
 what they want to take each flex period from a wide range of offerings 
 created by the teachers in the school (e.g. one teacher may offer extra 
 math help, one teacher may offer badminton in the gym, and another teacher 
 may offer a meditation class). The teacher offerings are unique for each 
 time a flex class is held throughout the school year, and each time the 
 student can choose something different to take. The flex class in the 
 course workload card is really a placeholder class. The icon indicates 
 that this class has unique flex class functionality in edsembli CONNECT 
 for teachers and students.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes12.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:29px;" border="0"/></span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">CTS class (Alberta only)</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The class is considered the master 
 class of a Career and Technology Studies course or a module class. Typically, 
 the CTS master class is scheduled into the timetable in a specific period, 
 and the student takes many modules as part of their course. The CTS module 
 classes are not scheduled into a period. </p>
<p></p>
Although only the master class appears in the course workload cards, hovering 
 over the icon will indicate whether it is a CTS master or CTS module. 
 
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes14a.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:29px;" border="0"/></span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Continuous entry class</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The class is considered a continuous 
 entry class, which means the student may start and complete the course 
 at their own pace. The student will have their own start and end times. 
 </p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">________________________________________</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Here is the detailed information on each of the possible workload cards:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Course_workload_current" id="Course_workload_current"></a>Course 
 workload – current</span></h3>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The ‘current&#39; workload card represents 
 the classes that the student is taking right now based on the school’s 
 current date. If a class is scheduled in the semester/term of the current 
 date, it will be considered current.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">If the class is continuous entry, each 
 student has their own start and end dates which are independent from the 
 class start and end dates. If the student’s unique start and end 
 dates indicate that the student is still taking the class on the school’s 
 current date, it is considered a current class.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Course_workload_upcoming" id="Course_workload_upcoming"></a>Course 
 workload – upcoming</span></h3>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The ‘upcoming’ workload card represents 
 the classes that the student will be taking in the future. Based on the 
 school’s current date, if a class is scheduled in a future semester/term, 
 it will be considered upcoming.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">If looking at next year’s workload (e.g. 
 NEXT YEAR tab is selected), all classes that are currently scheduled into 
 the student’s next year&#39;s  timetable will be considered future and 
 therefore will appear on the upcoming workload card. Any courses that 
 the student has requested for next year but are not yet scheduled into 
 the student’s timetable will appear on the ‘unscheduled’ workload card 
 described below.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Course_workload_completed" id="Course_workload_completed"></a>Course 
 workload – completed</span></h3>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">The ‘completed’ workload card represents 
 the classes that the student has finished. Based on the school’s current 
 date, if a class is scheduled in a past semester/term, it will be considered 
 completed. If the student dropped the class or withdrew from the 
 school prior to the class’ end date, it will appear on the ‘dropped’ card 
 as it is not considered completed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;"> </p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">If the class is continuous entry, each 
 student has a unique start and end date independent from the class start 
 and end dates. If the student’s unique start and end dates indicate that 
 the student has taken the course in the past (end date is prior to the 
 school’s current date), it is considered a completed class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes19.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:984px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Course_workload_dropped" id="Course_workload_dropped"></a>Course 
 workload – dropped</span></h3>
<p>The ‘dropped’ workload card represents the classes that the student 
 started but did not finish. If the student dropped the class or withdrew 
 from the school prior to the class’ end date, you&#39;ll see it here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes20.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:712px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Course_workload_unscheduled" id="Course_workload_unscheduled"></a>Course 
 workload – unscheduled</span></h3>
<p>The ‘unscheduled’ workload card may only apply when looking at next 
 year’s workload (NEXT YEAR tab is selected). This card shows the 
 courses the student has requested for the next school year <br/>
(as recorded in <a href="stu-class-info-course-selections.htm">Class info 
 &gt; Course selections</a>), but the school has not yet assigned the student 
 into a class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="assets/images/class-info-classes21.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:894px;" border="0"/></p>
