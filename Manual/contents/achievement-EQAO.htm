  <h1>Student records &gt; Achievement &gt; EQAO</h1>
  <hr align="center" style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify;

  <p><strong style="font-size: 20pt">Overview</strong></p>
  <p>This option is only available to Ontario secondary schools.</p>
  <p>Ontario students need to write provincial assessments administered by the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO), an independent agency of the Ministry of Education. EQAO assesses how well Ontario&#39;s public education system is developing students&#39; reading, writing and math skills. EQAO tests are typically done when a student is in a specific grade, or taking a specific course (in secondary school).  The following tests are administered by EQAO:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li>Grade 3 (reading, writing, math)</li>
    <li>Grade 6 (reading, writing, math)</li>
    <li>Grade 9 (math)</li>
    <li>Grade 10 Literacy Test (OSSLT)</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p>All students who attend publicly funded schools and who follow the Ontario curriculum are required to write them.  Students with special education needs are permitted some accommodations that are consistent with their regular classroom assessment practices. Special provisions may also be permitted for English language learners. If a student does not have the ability to participate in part or all of the assessment, even with accommodations, the principal may exempt him or her in consultation with the parents or guardians and educators.</p>
  <p>The EQAO option is where the student&#39;s accommodations are recorded so that they may be included in the information that is sent to EQAO when they require information about the students who should be writing the assessments at each school. Accommodations may be unique to each assessment and may vary between years.</p>
  <p>When a student completes the EQAO assessment, and results are imported into edsembli SIS, they may be viewed using the <a href="achievement-assessment-results.htm">Achievement &gt; Assessment results</a> option in the student&#39;s record. The only exception to this is the OSSLT results.  They are part of this EQAO option.</p>
  <p>To set EQAO accommodations and see OSSLT results, select the EQAO option in the Achievement sub-menu of the student&#39;s record.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <h3>EQAO accommodations</h3>
  <p>A card will appear titled EQAO accommodations. It will use a tab strip to navigate between the different EQAO assessments. The tabs are titled GRADE 3, GRADE 6, GRADE 9 and OSSLT as shown here. Only the assessments that may apply to a student will appear. For example, a student in grade 9 or higher will see all assessments, and a student in grade 5 will only see the grade 3 assessment.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/stu-eqao2.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 969px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As you navigate between the assessments, the fields on the page will adjust to reflect the accommodation info collected by EQAO each school year for that assessment. This is an example of the types of accommodations that might apply.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/stu-eqao3.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 969px;" /></p>
  <p>Select the Edit icon to edit this info. Edits are saved real-time, so select the check mark icon to disable the edit mode when done. While editing, some yes/no fields will enable additional fields. For example, if coloured paper is checked, then the colour of the paper is selected from the colours options defined by EQAO.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/stu-eqao4.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 173px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <h4>OSSLT completion information</h4>
  <p>When a student completes the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT), the completion information is also recorded on the same page as the EQAO accommodations for this test. The completion information is located above the accommodation fields.</p>
  <p>Here is an example of the completion information, showing a student who has completed the OSSLT.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/stu-eqao6.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 970px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Here is an example of a student who did not complete portions of the OSSLT:</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/stu-eqao5.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 970px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If a student is unsuccessful in the OSSLT, they may enroll in the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Course (OSSLC). Upon successful completion of that course, the student&#39;s Completion status must be set to OSSLC English (or French).</p>
