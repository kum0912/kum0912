<p> </p>
<h2>Overview </h2>
<p>This section contains information specific to Ontario schools. Be sure 
 to also refer to the main completed 
 courses section for additional information that applies to all schools, 
 regardless of province. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ontario secondary schools are responsible for generating a student’s 
 official transcript, following all guidelines required for the establishment, 
 maintenance, issue and storage of the Ontario Student Transcript (OST). 
 The OST form is available in English and French.  Refer to the OST 
 manual, published by the Ministry of Education, for regulations and procedures 
 that apply to the recording of information in various situations. This 
 manual is periodically revised and it may be downloaded from <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/ost/ost.html">http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/ost/ost.html</a>. 
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since the1999-2000 school year, Ontario schools have been required to 
 provide a complete record of students’ performance in grade 11 and 12 
 course, where both successful and unsuccessful attempts at completing 
 grade 11 and 12 courses must appear on the OST. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The OST will include:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>all Grade 9 and 10 courses successfully completed by the student, 
	 with percentage grades obtained and credits earned;  </li>
	<li>all Grade 11 and 12 courses completed successfully or attempted 
	 unsuccessfully by the student, with percentage grades obtained and 
	 credits earned;  </li>
	<li>all equivalent credits granted through the Prior Learning Assessment 
	 and Recognition (PLAR) equivalency process under OS/OSS or through 
	 the equivalency process under OSIS;  </li>
	<li>all Grade 10 courses for which the student successfully challenged 
	 for credit through the PLAR challenge process, with percentage grades 
	 obtained and credits earned;  </li>
	<li>all Grade 11 and 12 courses for which the student successfully 
	 or unsuccessfully challenged for credit through the PLAR challenge 
	 process, with percentage grades obtained and credits earned; • identification 
	 of compulsory credits, including credits that are substitutions for 
	 compulsory credits identified by the ministry as diploma requirements; 
	  </li>
	<li>confirmation that the student has completed the forty hours of 
	 community involvement;  </li>
	<li>confirmation that the student has successfully completed the provincial 
	 secondary school literacy requirement.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Since September 1, 1999, the OST has also had to include a record of 
 the achievement of exceptional students who have taken “alternative courses”. 
 Alternative courses are non-credit, individualized courses that are documented 
 in a student’s Individual Education Plan (IEP) and that comprise alternative 
 expectations – that is, expectations not found in the Ontario curriculum. 
 These are also known as ‘K courses’. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The completed courses option in the student’s record provides a record 
 of the student’s completed courses that may include courses that are not 
 part of the official transcript (e.g. grade 9 and 10 courses attempted 
 but not successfully completed).  The official OST generated for 
 the student will automatically include only those courses which are required 
 on the transcript. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Courses are automatically added to the student’s transcript when the 
 school runs <a href="../achievement/add-completed-courses.htm">Achievement 
 &gt; Completed courses &gt; Add completed courses</a>.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When a student drops a grade 11 or 12 course, a dialogue will appear 
 so that the school can decide whether this withdrawn course should be 
 added to the transcript along with their current percentage grade as per 
 this OST requirement:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">For students 
 who have withdrawn from a course after five instructional days following 
 the issue of the first provincial report card in a semestered school or 
 five instructional days following the issue of the second provincial report 
 card in a non-semestered school, enter the student’s percentage grade 
 at the time of withdrawal.</span> </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>If the student’s graduation requirements indicate that the student is 
 in a Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) program, then you will have access 
 to additional features related to the categorization of the SHSM compulsory 
 credits. For example, the student’s list of completed courses will include 
 a column for the SHSM category, and if editing a course, a SHSM tab is 
 available to specify credit substitutions (just like the SUB./EQUIVALENCY 
 CREDITS tab for regular graduation requirements except these are for SHSM 
 requirements). The SHSM record may be printed in addition to the student’s 
 transcript. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a id="Completed_courses"></a>Completed courses </h2>
<p>From the student’s record, use the Acheivement &gt; Completed courses 
 option to see the student’s completed courses. This is an example of the 
 Completed courses for an Ontario student. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img src="assets/images/ach-comp-courses-on1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:764px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Due to the number of fields recorded for each completed course, it may 
 be necessary to scroll to the right to see more fields, or select the 
 row with the course (e.g. row click) to access the Details option to see 
 all the fields for that one completed course. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The completed courses area also contains class attendance information 
 that is automatically transferred based on the daily attendance taken 
 by the school.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Within edsembli SIS, schools can track the compulsory credits for graduation 
 by categorizing each credit earned. If a completed course has multiple 
 credits in different categories (e.g. a PLE, EQV or Q course in Ontario), 
 or if the completed course is to be considered a substitution for a required 
 credit, then the SUB./EQUIVALENCY CREDIT tab may be used for this purpose. 
 Ontario schools have a SHSM tab option as well for substitutions/equivalency 
 credits related to a student’s SHSM program (it functions the same except 
 that it shows the student’s SHSM requirements rather than the regular 
 graduation requirements).  For more information on this function, 
 see the main Completed courses 
 documentation. </p>
<p>   </p>
<h2><a id="Completed_courses_fields_Ontario"></a>Completed courses fields 
 (Ontario) </h2>
<p>Adding or editing a completed course will provide access to the following 
 fields on the COURSE tab: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Course code</span>, 
 <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">title</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">grade</span>:  Indicates 
 the course the student completed. The title, grade and course number (if 
 applicable) are all attributes of the course and are automatically set 
 based on the setup of the code). For those unfamiliar with Ontario course 
 codes, the Ministry’s OST documentation provides a brief explanation of 
 the course codes.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note about the printed transcript:  </p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The course grade will appear as N/A for alternative courses which 
	 do not lead to credit (courses that start with K). These courses should 
	 be flagged automatically as “Alternative expectations”  and ‘A’ 
	 will show in the Notes column. </li>
	<li>Courses that start with FSF, FEF or FIF will show ‘F’ in the Notes 
	 column. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Mark</span>:  The 
 student’s final mark in the course. Any alphanumeric mark is allowed up 
 to 3 characters, with a maximum numeric mark of 100. Equivalent credit 
 courses (courses that start with EQV, PLE or Q) have no mark so EQV will 
 appear automatically. Alternative courses which do not lead to credits 
 (aka K courses) may have a numeric mark entered or the letter L if ‘ALT’ 
 is to appear as the student’s mark.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Credits attempted</span>: 
  Indicates the credits of the course that would be applied to the 
 student if successfully completed the course. This value is based on the 
 credits of the class that was in the student’s timetable (if automatically 
 added) or based on the setup of the code (if manually added). The attempted 
 credits may be edited, if needed, to any number up to 99.99.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note about the printed transcript:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The credit will always format automatically to 2 decimals. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Credits earned</span>: 
 Indicates the credits that the student has earned. Earned credits will 
 be automatically set to the same value as the attempted credits when a 
 mark of 50 or higher is entered. This may be changed, if needed. Withdrawn 
 courses, as required by OST requirements, will have W for the credit value. 
  When a student has a passing mark, and a credit value of 0, the 
 credit will appear as R (for repeat) on the list of completed courses 
 and on the printed transcript. Repeated grade 11 and 12 courses are included 
 on the official OST. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Notes about the printed transcript: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>the credits will appear as N/A for alternative courses which do 
	 not lead to credit (courses that start with K).  </li>
	<li>the word “partial” will appear after the course title if the student 
	 earns fewer credits that the attempted credits and the course is a 
	 multiple-credit college or university delivered dual credit course 
	 for which the passing grade established by the college or university 
	 is greater than 50% (e.g. the student received partial credits for 
	 the parts of the course that the student successfully completed). 
	  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Completion date</span>: 
 The date on which the student completed the requirements for a course, 
 or the date the student withdrew from a course (applicable to grade 11 
 or 12 courses only). </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note about the printed transcript</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Only the year and month appear on the printed transcript in the 
	 format yyyy/mm. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">School</span>:  Indicates 
 the school where the course was taken. The board is responsible for the 
 setup of the schools that are available for selection in this field. Start 
 typing the school name then select the school from the list of matching 
 schools. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note about the printed transcript:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>If the school is not this school, the printed transcript can optionally 
	 include an asterisk before the date to identify courses completed 
	 at other schools. </li>
	<li>If the school is flagged as a private school in the <a href="../setup/setup-school-configuration.htm">school 
	 setup configuration</a>, a “P” will appear in the Notes column when 
	 the transcript is printed from a publicly funded secondary school 
	 (P = credit earned at an inspected private school by a student registered 
	 in a publicly funded school) </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Category</span>: Displays 
 the category of the course. This will be used to automatically determine 
 whether the earned credits will be considered compulsory credits (e.g. 
 credits that the student is required to fulfil as part of <a href="achievement-grad-reqmts.htm">graduation 
 requirements</a>).   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a completed course has multiple credits in different categories (e.g. 
 a PLE, EQV or Q course in Ontario), or if the completed course is to be 
 considered a substitution for a required credit, then the SUB./EQUIVALENCY 
 CREDIT tab may be used for this purpose. Ontario schools have a SHSM tab 
 option as well for substitutions/equivalency credits related to a student’s 
 SHSM program (it functions the same except that it shows the student’s 
 SHSM requirements rather than the regular graduation requirements).  For 
 more information on this function, see the main Completed 
 courses documentation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Notes about the printed transcript: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The compulsory column in the transcript is automatically determined. 
	 </li>
	<li>A “X” will appear in this column for courses in which a compulsory 
	 credit has been earned. </li>
	<li>For partial compulsory credits (e.g., Civics, Grade 10), the earned 
	 credit value will appear for the compulsory course rather than an 
	 X (e.g. 0.50).  </li>
	<li>When one credit of a two-credit cooperative education course is 
	 being used as a compulsory credit, a ‘1’ appears in this column. This 
	 is automatically determined. </li>
	<li>When the category is changed from the default, it will be considered 
	 a substitution and will generate an X in the “Note” column. Such substitutions 
	 can only be made with the approval of the principal.  </li>
	<li>H will appear in the notes column if the course is a compulsory 
	 credit for the student’s SHSM program. This is automatically determined. 
	 </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Course attendance – 
 Absent, Excused, Late</span> and <span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Possible</span>: 
  Attendance info is automatically recorded when the course is automatically 
 added, if the class is taking regular period attendance (rather than am/pm 
 attendance).  This info includes the number of times the student 
 was absent or excused from class, or late to class.  The ‘Possible’ 
 field represents the number of times the class was taught and the student 
 was expected to attend. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Prior Learning Assessment 
 and Recognition (PLAR) - PLAR type, Mature credit</span>:  Regular 
 day school students who transfer to an Ontario secondary school from home 
 schooling in Ontario, from a non-inspected private school in Ontario, 
 or from a school outside Ontario may be granted equivalent credits through 
 the PLAR equivalency process for regular day school students based on 
 the principal’s evaluation of their previous learning. Such credits may 
 be granted through the equivalency process or the challenge process. For 
 these courses, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PLAR type</span> needs 
 to be set to either Equivalency (Q, PLE and EQV courses) or Challenge. 
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Mature credit</span> 
 is an optional yes/no field to indicate whether the principal used the 
 PLAR process for mature students. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Course details – Instructional 
 language, Delivery, Course type, Dual credit</span>: These fields are 
 automatically assigned values based on the class that was in the student’s 
 timetable (if automatically added) or based on the setup of the code (if 
 manually added). They may be changed if needed. The Dual credit field 
 appears if the course type is set to dual credits.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Notes about the printed transcript: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>If the course type is set to a co-op value, ‘C’ will appear in 
	 the notes column. </li>
	<li>If the dual credit is set to a team-taught value, ‘T’ will appear 
	 in the notes column. </li>
	<li>If the instructional language is set to French in an English school, 
	 and the category is not Anglais, French or Français, then ‘F’ will 
	 appear in the notes column. ‘F’ also appears for courses starting 
	 with FSF, FIF, FEF. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Include in GPA calculations</span>: 
 Yes/no field to indicate whether this course is to be included in any 
 GPA (grade point average) calculations that the school may want to use 
 for their own purposes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>OST notes column – <span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Special 
 indicator, Modified curriculum, Alternative expectation, Interdisciplinary 
 studies</span>: Check these yes/no fields if applicable to the student’s 
 completed course.  If special indicator = yes, ‘S’ will appear in 
 the notes column; if modified curriculum = yes, ‘M’ will appear; if Alternative 
 expectation = yes, ‘A’ will appear; if Interdisciplinary studies = yes, 
 I will appear. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Notes about the printed transcript:  The 
 following notations may appear in this column:  </p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>S = special indicator noting that the student’s performance in 
	 a Grade 11 or 12 course or an OAC was affected by extraordinary circumstances 
	 </li>
	<li>I = interdisciplinary studies  </li>
	<li>F = course taught in French in a Core, Extended, or Immersion program
