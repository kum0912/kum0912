  <h1>Intro for central staff</h1>
  <p class="Style1"> </p>
  <p>The board/division/district staff includes those staff who need access to the data collected by the schools in edsembli SIS, and those staff who support the SIS for the schools. These individuals are entered as central office staff, with security access to those functions that apply to their role.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Central staff have access to all or selected schools, and may have access to unique reports that provide a centralized view of the data in schools. The board/division/district has centralized control over certain aspects of the SIS. This centralized control of tables and report definitions ensures consistency across the schools.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For most boards/divisions/districts, by the time you start using edsembli SIS, most of the setup has been done as part of the implementation, and the school and student data has been added. Based on this assumption, we would suggest you first start with the Student Records portion of the manual. Each student in the database has a student record which provides easy access to the wealth of data recorded for the student. Typically, central office staff have view rights to student data only, with all edits performed by those with permissions in the schools.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Once you have an understanding of the type of data that is available, become familiar with the functions and reports that are available to you based on your responsibilities, particularly if you are responsible for provincial, federal, and other agency reporting. We also strongly suggest that all users of edsembli SIS, read the section titled <a href="start-common-features.htm">Common Features</a> which explains features of the application that are the same regardless of your role and access rights.</p>
