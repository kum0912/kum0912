<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Provincial Approach to Student Information (PASI) is an initiative 
 by Alberta’s Ministry of Education to provide a mechanism for collecting 
 and sharing student-related data in an on-line, real-time environment. 
  The exchange of this information is used to make many decisions 
 by and for the student, the parent, the teacher, the school, the school 
 authority, Albert Education as well as many others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PASI integrates student information across the province in order to 
 support a student’s journey in education from Early Childhood Services 
 (ECS) to grade 12.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PASI created a central repository (PASI Core) that provides common data 
 submission and validation services to ensure that each school authority:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>Is using a common set of student information, and</li>
	<li>Has access to the student information it requires to deliver services 
	 to its students.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>As an authorized PASI Client, Maplewood’s PASI-enabled student information 
 system (SIS) will update the PASI Core when information about a student 
 is added or updated in Maplewood.  PASI will then provide the mechanism 
 for relevant education stakeholders to have access to the updated information, 
 in near real-time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Authorized users may see the PASI Core data using the Ministry’s PASIprep 
 application.  Although information may be entered directly into PASIprep, 
 this should not be necessary once the PASI integration is enabled in Maplewood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This document will explain how Maplewood works with PASI once the PASI 
 integration is enabled. As PASI expands to include new data collections, 
 Maplewood will assist school authorities and schools in enabling the PASI 
 integration.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Overview of the Information exchanged with PASI</h3>
<p>The following information in Maplewood is exchanged real-time with PASI:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Student info</span>: 
	 Alberta student number (ASN), Student name, birthdate, gender, source 
	 document type/number/date, citizenship, study permit expiry date (if 
	 applicable), Section 23 eligibility, date of death (if applicable), 
	 address, phone and information disclosure restrictions. See Student 
	 info in PASI on page 23 for detailed information.<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">School enrolment</span>: 
	 ASN, school number, school year, grade, student number, entry date 
	 to this school, exit date (if applicable), registration type, registration 
	 status, registration entry status, exit description, resident board, 
	 francophone board, FNMI, French hours, enrolment type codes, exceptionality 
	 codes, and grant codes. See School enrolment in PASI on page 29 for 
	 detailed information.<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Class section 
	 info</span>:  If a class provides course instruction for a provincially 
	 defined course, the following fields are exchanged:  course code, 
	 local section id (course and section letter), credits offered, delivery 
	 schedule, description, start date, end date, instructional language, 
	 instructional minutes offered, primary delivery method, school code 
	 (#), school year, section term.  See Classes (PASI Sections) 
	 on page 38 for detailed information.<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Course enrolments 
	 (and marks)</span>:  A course enrolment exists for every provincially 
	 defined course in the student’s timetable, and when the course is 
	 completed, the mark information is included as part of the course 
	 enrolment information.  The fields include:  ASN, Course 
	 code, start date, end date, course enrolment status, credits attempted, 
	 instructional minutes received, dual enrolment, funding requested, 
	 mark format, mark value, mark assignment date, and mark approved. 
	  See Timetables (PASI Course Enrolments) on page 49 for details 
	 on these fields.  See Add completed Courses (PASI Marks) on page 
	 62 for detailed information on how marks are updated to PASI.<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Evaluated marks</span>: 
	  These are the courses that the student took outside of the Alberta 
	 school system, where the learning has been evaluated by this school 
	 and an equivalent Alberta course is granted to the student.  The 
	 following fields include: ASN, Course code, credits attempted, evaluation 
	 method, evaluation date, organization code, school year, funding requested, 
	 mark format, mark value, and mark approved.   See Courses 
	 added directly to Completed Courses (PASI Evaluated marks) on page 
	 71 for detailed information.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h3>One time setup / annual review</h3>
<p>As part of the initial Maplewood setup, and at the start of each new 
 school year, we would suggest the following checks are made:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Calendar:  Make sure the calendar for the new school year has 
 accurate semester and term dates.  These dates are used to default 
 class start and end dates which are used in the student’s course enrolments 
 and the class sections reported to PASI. Check the calendar using:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="color: #007fff; font-style: italic;">Setup &gt; Calendar </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the More options icon to find the Semester/term dates option (shown 
 below).  This option is where you can see and edit the term dates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. Configuration:  Check that the school classification types, 
 school program offering types, and grade offering type fields are correct 
 for the current school year using:</p>
<p>Setup &gt; School Setup &gt; Configuration </p>
<p>3. Codes:  Division staff should check that any newly added codes 
 are flagged as provincially defined.  Schools offering new courses 
 should be using these provincially defined codes.  The PASI code 
 field must represent the provincially defined course code, as this field 
 represents the student’s course in PASI. </p>
<p>Setup &gt; School Setup &gt; Codes </p>
<p>Setup &gt; School Setup &gt; Courses  </p>
<p>Note:  Prerequisite information for provincially defined codes 
 is automatically updated as part of the PASI integration.  </p>
<p>4. Semester/term patterns:  Check that the correct PASI section 
 term is assigned to each semester/term pattern using:</p>
<p>Setup &gt; Class Setup &gt; Sem/term/day/period  </p>
<p>The PASI section term is part of the information provided to PASI for 
 each provincially defined class in the school.  It provides a general 
 description of when the class is taught.  Each semester term pattern 
 defined by the school requires a corresponding PASI section term.  Check 
 that these are correct.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note:  if the school uses ‘special schedules’, the PASI section 
 term is defined uniquely for each class.  The PASI section term that 
 will be sent to PASI is clearly displayed for each class using Setup &gt; 
 Class setup &gt; Classes as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Student records - Overview</p>
<p>Real-time sharing of student information happens for all students in 
 Maplewood in grades ECS (Early Childhood Service), 1 through 12.  If 
 a school offers pre-school, those students may be recorded in Maplewood 
 as non-PASI students.  A student’s grade determines whether the student’s 
 information is exchanged with PASI as follows:</p>
<p>Grade in Maplewood Grade sent to PASI Real-time exchange with PASI?</p>
<p>1 to 12 1 to 12 Yes</p>
<p>J, K, M, E, C, EC, P EC Yes</p>
<p>Any other grades Not applicable No</p>
<p>Student’s record – profile area</p>
<p>The profile area of a student’s record has PASI related features that 
 may appear for some students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Information disclosure restrictions:  These restrictions are used 
 when normal “right of access” to the student’s record does not apply. 
 If the student has an active information disclosure restriction (based 
 on effective and expiry dates), an icon will appear below the student’s 
 name.  Hovering over the icon will present the tool tip message indicating 
 the restriction type and the details entered by the school as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Disclosure restrictions are edited using:</p>
<p> Student’s record &gt; Personal &gt; Name &gt; Information disclosure 
 restriction   </p>
<p>18 or older icon:  If a student is 18 years or older, the following 
 icon will appear :</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PASI icons:  One of two PASI icons may appear in the student’s 
 profile area as follows:</p>
<p>  The student has PASI issues.  Hover over the icon to 
 see a tool tip message indicating the number of issues.  Select the 
 icon to jump directly to the PASI &gt; Summary page in the student’s record.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>   The student is not in PASI.  DO NOT IGNORE THIS 
 ICON. Typically this appears because the student is not in PASI at all 
 (no ASN).  This may also appear on the rare occasion if the student 
 info or school enrolment is not in PASI.  Hover over the icon to 
 see the  tool tip message which will provide details.  Select 
 the icon to jump directly to the PASI &gt; Summary page in the student’s 
 record (where a red alert box will appear that will provide further information 
 on how to proceed).  </p>
<p>Note:  non-PASI graded students will not have an icon even though 
 the student is not in PASI.   </p>
<p>Student’s record – Summary option</p>
<p>When a student’s record is first accessed, the record is opened to the 
 Summary page.  The PASI statistics card will appear on this page, 
 if the student has PASI issues.  This is similar to the PASI statistics 
 card on the dashboard, except the statistics are only considering this 
 student.  See PASI statistics on the Dashboard on page 14.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>If the student has the ‘not in PASI’ icon in the profile, the PASI statistics 
 card will appear as a red PASI alert such as this:</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Non-PASI students will show an informational card as follows :</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Student’s record - PASI options </p>
<p>From the student’s record, use the PASI menu for details on the student’s 
 information that is exchanged with PASI.  Non-PASI students do not 
 have a PASI menu because nothing is exchanged with PASI. </p>
<p>Here is the PASI menu within the student’s record:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Summary </p>
<p>The Summary option provides a summary of the student’s status in PASI. 
  This includes the student’s ASN status, PASI Issues, and Alerts 
 as show here. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a student is not in PASI, red alert cards will appear on the Summary 
 page, including simple options to resolve the issue. Here is an example 
 of a red alert card:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Student info, School enrolment, Course enrolment, Evaluated marks</p>
<p>Each of the other PASI submenu options provide access to the detailed 
 information shared with PASI for specific ‘record types’ of student information. 
  The record types correspond to the options: student info, school 
 enrolment, course enrolment, evaluated marks . You can easily switch between 
 record types by selecting the record type from the menu, or selecting 
 the record type from the drop down list in the card title:</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>This detailed information for each record type includes:</p>
<p>• PASI compare  feature that shows each field in Maplewood vs PASI</p>
<p>• Alerts returned from PASI about the student info exchanged with PASI 
 (if applicable)</p>
<p>• Rejections returned from PASI for student info exchanged with PASI 
 (if applicable)</p>
<p>• Audit history</p>
<p>Use the tab options to navigate between these different features.  See 
 Common PASI features on page 10 for more information about PASI compare, 
 alerts, rejections, and audit history.  </p>
<p>PASI common features</p>
<p>When accessing the Student info, School enrolment, Course enrolment, 
 or Evaluated marks options in the student’s record, each option will vary 
 slightly based on the type of information displayed, but there are many 
 common features that are explained here.  These common features also 
 apply to the school’s classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PASI compare</p>
<p>Here is an example of the PASI COMPARE tab for Student info:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each field that is exchanged with PASI appears in a row.  The columns 
 show the value in Maplewood and the value in PASI.  When the values 
 are the same, they appear as below.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the values differ, the field is considered as having a discrepancy. 
  The number of discrepancies is indicated in the tab (e.g. PASI COMPARE 
 (3) in this example) and an alert icon appears in the card title. Scroll 
 down the list of fields, and the fields with discrepancies are clearly 
 indicated in yellow with the Alert icon as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If all the values in Maplewood are correct, use the Push to PASI icon 
 to submit the Maplewood values to PASI.  If all the values in PASI 
 are correct, use the Pull from PASI icon to pull the PASI values into 
 Maplewood.  These icons are enabled when the push/pull functionality 
 is available.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Once the information is pushed or pulled, the page will refresh and 
 the values should match.  If the values don’t match and there are 
 still discrepancies, look at the ALERTS and/or REJECTIONS tabs to see 
 if there is a reason why the fields were not updated.</p>
<p>Although it should not be necessary, the Refresh icon may be used to 
 reload the page with the latest compare results.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alerts (Warnings/Advice)</p>
<p>Alerts are informational messages returned from PASI based on the information 
 submitted from Maplewood. If there are alerts, the ALERT tab is enabled, 
 and the number of alerts appears in brackets. An example of an alert is 
 shown below:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are 2  types of alerts:</p>
<p>Warning: The data provided is failing a business rule and requires updating 
 in order to be corrected. PAY ATTENTION TO WARNINGS.</p>
<p>Advice: The data provided is suspected of being invalid and may require 
 updating in order to be corrected.</p>
<p>Each alert will have an alert status as follows:</p>
<p>Acknowledged:  The advice provided has been reviewed and no updates 
 to the data are required.</p>
<p>Unacknowledged:  The core alert has not been acknowledged.</p>
<p>In Progress:  A resolution to the core alert is currently being 
 worked on.</p>
<p>Overridden:  The warning provided has been reviewed and overridden 
 by an internal Alberta Education department.</p>
<p>Alert statuses may be optionally changed for the school’s own internal 
 tracking purposes.  For example, a new alert may default Unacknolwedged, 
 but the school may change it to Acknowledged to signify that the alert 
 has been reviewed and no data changes will be made.  In Maplewood, 
 PASI statistics will count unacknowledged advice.</p>
<p>Row click the alert to access the other alert statuses that may be assigned 
 (as shown below):</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Rejections</p>
<p>Rejections are informational messages returned from PASI based on the 
 information submitted from Maplewood. DO NOT IGNORE REJECTIONS as the 
 information is not in PASI. If there are rejections, the REJECTIONS tab 
 is enabled, and the number of rejections appears in brackets. An example 
 of a rejection is shown below:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The information must be corrected in Maplewood.  Correcting the 
 data will submit the new information real-time and the rejections should 
 be cleared.</p>
<p>Audit history</p>
<p>As information is changed in Maplewood and PASI, these changes are tracked 
 in an audit trail that may be useful in problem solving.  The audit 
 history may appear slightly different for each record type as it will 
 depend upon the type of information in the audit file.  Here is an 
 example of the AUDIT HISTORY tab for an evaluated mark:</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>________________________________________ </p>
<p>PASI statistics (Dashboard) </p>
<p>On the dashboard page, a PASI statistics card will appear showing the 
 number of PASI related items that exist for the school (or division). 
  A similar statistics card appears in the student’s record showing 
 the similar statistics for the school.  Selecting the PASI statistics 
 card from the dashboard provides a shortcut to the detailed information 
 in PASI manager.  </p>
<p>Here is an example of the PASI statistics card: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following statistics will appear if applicable:</p>
<p>Not in PASI:  This represents students who are not in PASI (no 
 ASN), or students who are in PASI but have student info  or school 
 enrolment info that is not in PASI (e.g. information is in Maplewood but 
 it is not in PASI at all).  These issues should receive immediate 
 attention.  Selecting the PASI statistics card will open PASI manager. 
  These students will be identified on the NOT IN PASI tab.  Selecting 
 each student will open the student’s record at the PASI &gt; Summary option 
 where further information will be provided.</p>
<p>Note:  PASI manager will show the number of students who have something 
 not in PASI, while the statistics card will count the number of things 
 not in PASI.  For example, a student who has no ASN, no student info, 
 and no school enrolment in PASI will count as 3 on the statistics card, 
 but will count as 1 student in PASI manager.</p>
<p>Rejections: Rejections are informational messages returned from PASI 
 based on the information submitted from Maplewood. Do not ignore rejections 
 as the information is not in PASI. Selecting the PASI statistics card 
 will open PASI manager.  Go to the ALERTS tab and use the Alert type 
 filter to select Rejections. Selecting each item will open the student’s 
 record at the PASI &gt; Summary option where further information will 
 be provided.  Correcting the data will submit the new information 
 real-time and the rejections should be cleared.</p>
<p>Warnings:  Warnings are informational messages returned from PASI 
 based on the information submitted from Maplewood. The data provided is 
 failing a business rule and requires updating in order to be corrected. 
 Pay attention to warnings.  Selecting the PASI statistics card will 
 open PASI manager.  Go to the ALERTS tab and use the Alert type filter 
 to select Warnings. Selecting each item will open the student’s record 
 at the PASI &gt; Summary option where further information will be provided. 
  Correcting the data will submit the new information real-time and 
 the warnings should be cleared.</p>
<p>Notifications:  Although the data in Maplewood and PASI should 
 be in synch in near real-time, PASI will create a notification if it detects 
 that the data is not in synch.  Notifications typically appear when 
 the record versions are not in synch, such as when data is changed directly 
 in PASIprep rather than Maplewood or if the service used to update data 
 in PASI failed to successfully resolve a notification.  </p>
<p>Selecting the PASI statistics card will open PASI manager.  From 
 the STUDENTS tab, use the Alert type filter to select Notifications.  Selecting 
 each student will open the student’s record at the PASI &gt; Summary option 
 where further information will be provided.  </p>
<p>If a notification exists, the following icon will appear in the app 
 bar of the affected PASI record in the student’s record: </p>
<p>  (replace image showing tool tip ‘Notification from PASI’ 
 – CWC-2826 needs to be done)</p>
<p>Notifications do not provide any details on the cause of the notification, 
 however, the PASI COMPARE tab will typically show discrepancies in data 
 fields.  Depending on what fields differ between Maplewood and PASI, 
 use the Push to PASI or Pull from PASI icons to resolve the differences.</p>
<p>Unacknowledged Advice:  Only unacknowledged and in progress advice 
 is counted in this number.     Advice alerts are informational 
 messages returned from PASI based on the information submitted from Maplewood. 
 The data provided is suspected of being invalid and may require updating 
 in order to be corrected.  All advice will initially be set as unacknowledged. 
  An advice alert may be set to Acknowledged once it has been reviewed 
 and no updates to the data are required.  An alert may also be set 
 to In Progress if a resolution is currently being worked on.  Selecting 
 the PASI statistics card will open PASI manager.  Go to the ALERTS 
 tab and use the Alert type filter to select Advice. Selecting each item 
 will open the student’s record at the PASI &gt; Summary option where further 
 information will be provided.  Go to the appropriate PASI submenu 
 option then select the ALERTS tab.  Select the row with the advice 
 alert to see the different alert statuses that may be set (e.g. acknowledged).</p>
<p>PASI manager </p>
<p>PASI manager provides access to all the PASI alerts in one central location. 
  PASI manager is access from the PASI menu option from the main menu, 
 or by selecting the PASI statistics card located on the dashboard.  </p>
<p>IMAGE of menu showing PASI option &amp; Image of PASI stats card?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>If PASI manager is accessed from the division office, a schools filter 
 is provided, and the school code is listed in each row as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PASI manager uses tabs to organize the PASI information that may require 
 attention.  Each tab provides a count of the number of records that 
 appear on each tab.  Selecting a record on a tab will open a new 
 browser window opened to student’s record, or the PASI compare interface 
 if opening a class section record.</p>
<p>Some tabs will provide the ability to filter the records, like this 
 example where the students may be filtered by Record type and Alert type:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To use the filter, select the drop down arrow and check the record(s) 
 or alert type(s) to include.  Then click the Filter floating action 
 button to apply the new filters (refresh the list to show just those students 
 matching the new filters).</p>
<p>Where provided, use the expand/contract arrows to show more or less 
 detail.  In this example, the second student is expanded to show 
 SUMMARY INFO.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The expanded information may include tabs to organize the data, like 
 this example where the ALERTS tab provides further information:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Selecting a row with a record type (e.g. Student School Enrolment in 
 the above example), will open the new browser window to that record area 
 of the student’s record (e.g. PASI &gt; school enrolment option).  Selecting 
  the student’s name, as in the example below, will open the student’s 
 record at the PASI &gt; Summary option. The student’s record will always 
 open in a new browser window. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When done with the student’s record, you may close the browser window 
 and return to the browser tab with PASI manager opened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Here is an example of the NOT IN PASI tab:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the student and then proceed as directed on the student’s record. 
  </p>
<p>Here is an example of the ALERTS tab:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the student and then proceed to address the alerts, or set the 
 alert status from the student’s record.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the MARK APPROVALS tab:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Expand the row to see MARK DETAILS or ALERTS (use the tabs to navigate), 
 or select the row to open the student’s record in a new browser window. 
  </p>
<p>Here is an example of the CLASS SECTIONS tab:</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>From the CLASS SECTIONS tab, use the filter to show “all” classes, including 
 those that have no issues.   Selecting a row on this tab will 
 open a new browser window with the PASI compare feature that exists from 
 the classes table.  Although rare, if a class section were manually 
 added in PASIprep but not in Maplewood, that class would appear as a class 
 called PASI only in the list, and if selected, the class would appear 
 in the PASI side but not the Maplewood side (and a delete from PASI FAB 
 would appear).</p>
<p>Regardless of what tab you are looking at in PASI manager, there is 
 a Refresh icon in the app bar, that will refresh all the data without 
 having to leave PASI manager. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Adding new students</p>
<p>Done </p>
<p>Alberta Student Number</p>
<p>An Alberta Student Number (ASN) is a unique nine-digit number.  An 
 ASN is assigned to a student when they first enroll in an academic school 
 in grade kindergarten (ECS - Early Childhood Service) to grade 12.</p>
<p>When a K-12 student is first added into Maplewood, if the student is 
 not already in PASI, a new ASN will be automatically assigned to the student, 
 using the real-time PASI exchange.  If the student already exists 
 in PASI from another school authority, then the student’s original ASN 
 will be automatically assigned to the new student.</p>
<p>If a school offers pre-school, those students may be recorded in Maplewood 
 as non-PASI students.  A student’s grade determines whether the student’s 
 information is exchanged with PASI as shown below, and the student’s ASN 
 is required for this exchange:</p>
<p>Grade in Maplewood Grade sent to PASI Real-time exchange with PASI?</p>
<p>1 to 12 1 to 12 Yes</p>
<p>J, K, M, E, C, EC, P EC Yes</p>
<p>Any other grades Not applicable No</p>
<p>There may be times where a student is in a PASI grade, but the student 
 did not get an ASN assigned.  This may occur if there was an interruption 
 in the PASI service at the time the student was added, or if a student 
 has moved from a non-PASI grade to a PASI grade.</p>
<p>If a student should have an ASN but does not, when the student’s record 
 is accessed, the following card will appear:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select the ADD STUDENT TO PASI button on the card.</p>
<p>A search will be done to see if the student already exists in PASI. 
  </p>
<p>If no matching student is found, from the dialogue presented below, 
 select the ENROL CURRENT STUDENT button.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If one or more matching students exist in PASI, the student(s) will 
 be presented.  If the student in Maplewood matches one of the found 
 students, check the box to the left of the student’s name, then select 
 the ENROL SELECTED STUDENT button as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the student in Maplewood is not the same as any of the students presented, 
 do not check any of the boxes and select the ENROL CURRENT STUDENT button 
 as shown here:</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Upon selecting either the ENROL CURRENT STUDENT or ENROL SELECTED STUDENT 
 buttons, a new ASN will be automatically assigned to the student and the 
 student’s information will be synched to PASI.</p>
<p>Student info in PASI  (student record manual)</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>From the student’s record, use the PASI menu for details on the student’s 
 information that is exchanged with PASI.  Non-PASI students do not 
 have a PASI menu because nothing is exchanged with PASI. </p>
<p>You’ll find the Student info menu option under the PASI submenu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Student info option provides a detailed view of student-specific 
 information collected in PASI.  It will default to the PASI COMPARE 
 tab to show the fields collected by PASI (column titled Field name), the 
  Maplewood value (column 2), and the PASI value (column 3) as shown 
 here: </p>

<p>Codes </p>
<p>The list of all course codes that are/have/will be used by the division 
 are listed in the codes table using the menu options Setup &gt; Class 
 Setup &gt; Codes.   The school division is responsible for the 
 codes table.  Schools have ‘view only’ access to codes. Detailed 
 information about the list of codes may be found in http://www.maplewood.com/Maplewood%20connectEd%20for%20Schools/#t=Setup%2Fsetup-class-codes.htm. 
    This section describes specific features of the codes 
 for Alberta schools and authorities as part of the real-time exchange 
 with PASI. </p>
<p>As part of the integration with PASI, codes will be flagged as Provincially 
 Defined if the PASI code field contains a Ministry defined course code 
 (e.g. the Alberta course code).  The PASI code is used in the real-time 
 exchange with PASI.  Here is an example of a provincially defined 
 code:  </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Once a code is added to list of codes, the PASI code cannot be changed 
 if the code is provincially defined. Based on this PASI code, a number 
 of fields are automatically populated from PASI.  These fields are 
 non-editable (disabled) if the course is provincially defined:</p>
<p>• PASI code</p>
<p>• Grade</p>
<p>• Credit value</p>
<p>• Course titles (English and French)</p>
<p>• Effective and expiry dates</p>
<p>• Course evaluation method</p>
<p>• Course sequence series</p>
<p>• Course category (PASI)</p>
<p>• CTS module information (CTS module Y/N, Course strand and Instructional 
 level)</p>
<p>• Locally developed course flag</p>
<p>Only these non-PASI fields may be edited at Central Office, if the code 
 is provincially defined:  </p>
<p>• Code (Maplewood code)</p>
<p>• Course category (Maplewood)</p>
<p>• Language of instruction</p>
<p>• Primary delivery method</p>
<p>• Section delivery schedule</p>
<p>• Include in GPA calculations</p>
<p>Note:  All fields are editable if a code is not provincially defined 
 (however some PASI fields may not be available for editing).  The 
 PASI code field will be called “Course # (optional)” since it may be used 
 to record course numbers for non-PASI courses.  If you edit a non-provincially 
 defined course, and you start typing a Ministry code in the Course # field, 
 the list of available PASI codes will appear (as shown below).  Selecting 
 a PASI code from the list will automatically set the code to a provincially 
 defined course.</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Code fields</p>
<p>I would move the code fields section from setup – codes, to this section 
 here and remove it from codes in setup but put some text in setup section 
 like this “For details on the code fields for Alberta, see ….”.  Here’s 
 what I’d like to see in this section of the Alberta – PASI manual:</p>
<p>Code fields - Alberta</p>
<p>Alberta Education has defined a list of official course codes for courses 
 in grade 10 to 12 that may be used on official transcripts. The codes 
 table will contain any codes that have or will appear on an official transcript 
 for any student (even those who have attended in prior years).  The 
 official course codes are recorded in the PASI code field, and the code 
 may be the same as the official code, or another code that is more meaningful 
 to the division/schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PASI is an acronym for the Provincial Approach to Student Information, 
 an Alberta specific initiative that provides a shared view of student 
 data across the province. Data is shared between the PASI clients (school 
 and school authorities) and the PASI core data in the provincial database. 
 PASI collects information only for these official provincially defined 
 codes. If a code is provincially defined, and the division has Course 
 Mark Integration enabled, the codes from the PASI core database are automatically 
 synchronized with the codes table in Maplewood. Therefore, code changes/edits 
 are rarely required for grade 10 to 12 AB courses, and many fields are 
 not editable. The following fields are automatically populated from PASI, 
 and therefore, they are non-editable:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• Grade</p>
<p>• Credit value</p>
<p>• Course titles (English)</p>
<p>• Effective from and to dates</p>
<p>• Course evaluation method</p>
<p>• Course sequence series</p>
<p>• Course category (PASI)</p>
<p>• CTS module information (Course strand and Instructional level)</p>
<p>• Locally developed course flag</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Alberta codes table has 2 tabs: Details and Prerequisites.</p>
<p>Details</p>
<p>General:</p>
<p>Code: Alberta has provincial course codes such as SST1771 for a specific 
 grade 10 Social Studies curriculum. Using the SST1171 example, a division 
 may use SST1771 for both the code and the course number (referred to as 
 PASI code in AB). Alternately, a division can use a different code that 
 better suits their needs (e.g. SOC10-1) as long as SST1771 is the course 
 number.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PASI code: PASI code is the official course code defined by the province. 
 PASI code is the term AB schools will see in place of course number, but 
 both terms refer to the same field. If provincially defined, user must 
 select from the ministry&#39;s table of codes. If not provincially defined, 
 users can enter code of choice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Provincially Defined: Automatically set to Yes if the PASI code is a 
 valid Alberta course code. This field is not editable Yes/No field - Users 
 should sort by this column to identify any codes that didn&#39;t get synced 
 because their PASI code is wrong.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Grade: The grade level of the course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Credit value: Indicates the credits of the course that would be applied 
 to the student upon successful completion of the course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course title: The title of the course in English (if required).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>French title: The title of the course in French (if required).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Effective date: The first date that schools may start using this code.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Expiration date: The first date that schools may no longer use this 
 code.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Language of instruction  :  Indicates the language used when 
 providing instruction for a class section.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course evaluation method  :  Indicates the type of evaluation 
 associated with a course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Primary delivery method  :  Identifies how the class is delivered 
 based on the presentation method of the largest component of instructional 
 material.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Section delivery schedule  :  Indicates when the class section 
 is delivered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course sequence series  :  Indicates the order in which related 
 courses should be taken.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course category (PASI): Assists student in course selection based on 
 interest, credential program or special circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Include in GPA calculation:  Yes/no field to indicate whether this 
 course is to be included in any GPA calculations that the school may want 
 to use for their own purposes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Locally developed course:  Yes/no field to indicate that the course 
 is locally developed course code.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course category (Maplewood)   : This category field is used 
 in determining a student’s graduation requirements in Maplewood.  Although 
 PASI will also track this, divisions may augment the list for defining 
 their own graduation requirements that may vary from the provincial requirements 
 (e.g. if division requires religion credits but the province doesn’t). 
 See Graduation requirements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course subject(s)  :  Also known as categories for graduation 
 requirements indicates the subject area (i.e. branch of learning) to which 
 a course is related . This field is used to determine whether a code can 
 be used to fulfill a student’s graduation requirements. In addition to 
 the values defined by PASI provided below, divisions may augment the list 
 for defining their own graduation requirements that may vary from the 
 provincial requirements (e.g. if division requires religion credits but 
 the province doesn’t). Once PASI is enabled, this field is set by PASI 
 if the code is provincially defined codes, but it may be augmented with 
 division values if appropriate (e.g. religion code is set as Other by 
 the province, but the division also sets it as Religion).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CTS modules:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CTS module: Yes/no field to indicate whether the course is a CTS module. 
 If set to Yes, 2 additional  fields are enabled, which are only applicable 
 to CTS modules:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course instructional level  : Indicates the rigor of the curriculum 
 and thus the level of skills taught within a CTS course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course strand  : Indicates the strand (or career area) to which 
 a CTS course is related.</p>
<p>Prerequisite courses from PASI </p>
<p>As part of the integration with PASI, prerequisite codes will be automatically 
 populated from the information in PASI to the Central Office codes file 
 Prerequisite area.  Note, Maplewood’s prerequisite information will 
 list the Maplewood codes (e.g. if SCN3230 has a prerequisite of SCN2231, 
 but the division uses the Maplewood code MBIO20, you will see BIO20V in 
 Maplewood’s Prerequisites in the code table).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The prerequisite courses are also automatically updated in the courses 
 table. </p>
<p>PASI section terms</p>
<p>As part of the initial setup of Maplewood, each school would have created 
 or have been provided with semester/term patterns.  These patterns 
 are used in the setup of classes to define when a class is taught.  The 
 PASI section term is part of the information that is provided to PASI 
 for each class.  Take a moment to see that the PASI section term 
 is correct for each semester/term pattern.</p>
<p>Setup &gt; Class setup &gt; Sem/term/day/period card – THIS YEAR button</p>
<p>Use expand icon to see the PASI Section term column for each set as 
 shown:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the PASI section term is not set correctly, select the row to access 
 the Edit option:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Edit the PASI section term field by selecting the most appropriate value 
 from the drop down list of PASI values then select the SAVE button.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The PASI section term values are: Continuous, FullYear, Quarter1, Quarter2, 
 Quarter3, Quarter4, Semester1, Semester2, or Summer. </p>
<p>NOTE:  if a class is defined using the special schedule feature, 
 the PASI section term is specified as part of the setup of the individual 
 class as shown here (within Edit of the class):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Only courses flagged as provincially defined (in code table) require 
 a PASI section term.</p>
<p>Classes (PASI Sections)</p>
<p>If a class uses a provincially defined code, it will integrate with 
 PASI.  Classes are called Sections in PASI. </p>
<p>Changes to classes, using Setup &gt; Class Setup &gt; Classes, are submitted 
 to PASI in real-time.  </p>
<p>Classes will be listed in order by the code as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a provincially defined course has a class that was rejected by PASI, 
 it will appear in red and the alert icon will appear in the PASI alert 
 column as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sorting the classes by this first column will show whether or not the 
 school has any rejected classes.  Students in these classes will 
 not have their course enrolments in PASI until the class section is successfully 
 synched with PASI (red goes away). Every attempt has been made to ensure 
 that all provincially defined courses have their classes synched in PASI, 
 so it should be very rare that a class is not synched.  The above 
 example is due to the fact that the class has no semester/term pattern, 
 and therefore it has not PASI section term.  Classes cannot be saved 
 without a pattern so this example is only to illustrate what a rejection 
 might appear like.</p>
<p>The tool tip on the Alert icon will provide a description as to why 
 the class was rejected:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Editing the class will prominently display the alert as well.  Buttons 
 will appear so that the alert may be Acknowledged or Unacknowledged.  Acknowledging 
 a rejected class will not clear the rejection – the class will still appear 
 in red.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although classes with advice from PASI will not appear in red in the 
 initial list of classes, the advice will be prominently displayed when 
 editing the class as well:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the rejection, or advice, once the information 
 is corrected in Maplewood (typically by editing the class), the changes 
 are automatically submitted to PASI and alerts are automatically updated 
 based on the new information.</p>
<p>Note:  Rejected class sections mean that the class is not in PASI 
 and therefore the students’ course enrolments will also not be in PASI. 
  </p>
<p>PASI compare (class section in Maplewood vs PASI)</p>
<p>Whether the class has successfully synched with PASI or if it has been 
 rejected, you may compare the information about the class section in Maplewood 
 vs PASI. There are 2 ways to access the PASI compare  for a class:</p>
<p>1.  Row click the class to access the menu with the PASI compare 
 option.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>2. Edit the class and access the PASI compare icon in the tool bar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Upon selecting the PASI compare option, if the class is rejected, the 
 PASI compare will only provide access to the REJECTIONS tab as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the majority of classes, it will go to the PASI COMPARE tab as shown 
 here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Again, the information in Maplewood and PASI should be synched (no yellow 
 discrepancies).  If there are any discrepancies between Maplewood 
 and PASI, the row will appear in yellow as illustrated below (not a real 
 example but an illustration showing different Maplewood and PASI record 
 versions).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PASI collects the following information for each class section (for 
 grade 10 to 12 provincially defined courses):</p>
<p>• Record version:  A unique version number automatically maintained 
 as part of the PASI integration.  Pending version may appear if a 
 change is not yet applied.</p>
<p>• Section ID: A unique code automatically created by Maplewood. This 
 is for reference only.</p>
<p>• Course Code(s): The PASI code of the provincially defined code. See 
 Special note about CTS classes (on page 45) for examples of multiple course 
 codes appearing here.</p>
<p>• Local Section ID:  The class in Maplewood (course code and section 
 letter).</p>
<p>• Credits Offered:  The credit value of the class.</p>
<p>• Delivery Schedule:  The Section Delivery Schedule of the class 
 (EVG = Evening, REG = Regular, SAT = Weekend).</p>
<p>• Description:  The title of the code.  Note:  The Courses 
 file has a setting to allow the school to use the same title as the code 
 or to enter their own titles.  If the school has opted to define 
 their own title, it will appear here.</p>
<p>• Start Date/End Date:  The start and end dates defined for the 
 class in the classes file.</p>
<p>• Instructional language:  The language defined for the class.</p>
<p>• Instructional Minutes Offered:  This information is optional 
 and currently not part of integration.  It will always be blank.</p>
<p>• Primary Delivery Method:  The primary delivery method of the 
 class (REG = Regular, DSL = Distance Learning - Print based, HED = Home 
 Education, OFC = Off Campus, ORP = Outreach program, VTL = Distance Learning 
 – Online, CHA = Challenge).  </p>
<p>• School Code:  The school number of the school offering the class.</p>
<p>• School Year:  The school year (e.g. if 2017/2018 school year, 
 it will appear as 2018).</p>
<p>• Section/Term: This is based on the class schedule, specifically the 
 semester/term assigned to the class (see PASI Section Term on page 38). 
  The Section/Term values are as follows: Continuous, FullYear, Quarter1, 
 Quarter2, Quarter3, Quarter4, Semester1, Semester2, or Summer.</p>
<p>In addition to the PASI COMPARE tab, other tabs are enabled if applicable 
 to the class.  For example, the ALERTS tab as shown here:</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The AUDIT HISTORY tab is available to see detailed information each 
 time the class information was edited.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Career and Technology Studies (CTS) – Master/module classes</p>
<p>Career and technology studies (CTS) is a provincially authorized curriculum 
 for Alberta secondary schools that offers flexible programming using 1-credit 
 courses (modules). In Maplewood, there exists the ability to link CTS 
 module courses to a CTS master class (a non-provincially defined course 
 used for school organizational purposes).  This is the recommended 
 approach for both PASI course enrolments, report cards, and attendance. 
  Typically, the CTS master class is scheduled into an actual period 
 in the student’s timetable, and the CTS module classes are assigned to 
 a semester/term, but no actual period.  This allows the office to 
 take attendance for the master class, but allows the teachers to record 
 achievement and report card information for the CTS modules.  By 
 linking the CTS module classes to a master class, the report card can 
 easily group the modules together on the report.</p>
<p>Although linking CTS modules to a master class is optional, it is the 
 recommended approach for PASI.  If they are not linked, the CTS modules 
 will be reported to PASI in the same manner that all other classes are 
 reported.  </p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE:  Linking CTS modules and modules must be done during 
 the initial creation of the new CTS module class (before it has been established 
 in PASI as a new section).  After the CTS module class is added, 
 linking is no longer available.  </p>
<p>This section will describe how to link CTS masters and modules, and 
 how they are reported to PASI.</p>
<p>Linking CTS masters and modules</p>
<p>1. Define a CTS master course code:  The CTS master course code 
 can be any code that is meaningful to the school (e.g. FOD1000 for a grade 
 10 master foods course).  Boards/divisions may optionally define 
 the course in the Codes table, and since it will not have a valid PASI 
 code, the master course will not be provincially defined.  Alternately, 
 schools may define the course in the Courses table.</p>
<p>From the board/division:  Setup &gt; School setup &gt; Codes     OR</p>
<p>From the school:  Setup &gt; School setup &gt; Courses</p>
<p>Notes:  CTS master courses must have the reportable box checked 
 off if grouping modules together on the report card.  The reportable 
 box is in the setup of the course.  </p>
<p>CTS master courses have 0.00 credits.  When it is linked to modules, 
 it will use the credit value of the CTS module class (the class with the 
 highest credit value if classes have different credit values).</p>
<p>2. Create a CTS master class:  Using the master course code defined 
 in step 1, create a corresponding class (e.g. FOD1000k).  Make sure 
 that all the correct attributes are defined for the class as these attributes 
 will apply to all the modules (except for the day/period schedule).  There 
 is no master/module linking at this point. </p>
<p>From the school:  Setup &gt; School setup &gt; Classes</p>
<p>3. Create a CTS module class and link it to the master class:  Create 
 a new class for a module course (e.g FOD1010k).  The application 
 will detect that you are adding a CTS module, and therefore it will enable 
 the CTS master field.  Select the master class created in step 2 
 as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Upon selecting the CTS master class, some of the fields will be disabled 
 as their values are populated from the master class.  These fields 
 include:  primary delivery method, section delivery schedule, language 
 of instruction, instructional minutes offered, class start and end dates.</p>
<p>Typically, the CTS module classes are assigned a day/period pattern 
 that represents no actual period assigned (e.g. floater pattern) so that 
 the student can have any number of CTS classes without creating conflicts. 
 </p>
<p>Note: If you attempt to save the new CTS class without selecting the 
 master class, the following message will appear:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the class is saved, PASI will be updated real-time. </p>
<p>4. Repeat step 3 for all CTS module classes to be linked to the master 
 class:  For example, create FOD1020k and link it to FOD1000k, create 
 FOD1030k and link it to FOD1000k, etc.   </p>
<p>Note:  the FOD1000k master class will show all the modules linked 
 to it:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>PASI sections (for linked CTS master/module classes)</p>
<p>When a school creates the CTS master class, nothing is synched to PASI. 
  As soon as the school adds the first CTS module class, upon saving 
 that class, PASI will be automatically updated with a new class section. 
  As subsequent CTS module classes are added, the original PASI section 
 will be updated with the new courses that have been added to the master 
 class.  The end result shows the PASI section referring to the Master 
 class (FOD1000a) but that class has multiple courses (FOD1010, FOD1020, 
 FOD1030).</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the PASI compare for FOD1000k:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is an expanded view showing the Course Code(s) and Local Section 
 ID:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A student’s course enrolments are discussed in http://www.maplewood.com/Maplewood%20connectEd%20for%20Schools/#t=Students%2Fpasi-student-crse-enrolment.htm 
 but it is important to understand that although the CTS master and module 
 classes are linked, each module CTS class will be reported to PASI as 
 a unique course enrolment (eg. FOD1010, FOD1020, FOD1030 are distinct 
 course enrolments):</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Expanding the course enrolment shows how each CTS module course enrolment 
 can have unique information depending on the student’s enrolment in the 
 course:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Timetables (PASI Course Enrolments)</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>Every class in the school that uses a provincially defined code, will 
 integrate with PASI.  These classes are called Sections in PASI. 
  Changes to the setup of these classes are submitted to PASI in real-time. 
  </p>
<p>PASI also collects information about the students enrolled in these 
 provincially defined classes.  Each student’s class is called a Course 
 Enrolment in PASI, and it is linked to the corresponding class section 
 in PASI.  As these classes change in the students’ timetables, these 
 changes are submitted to PASI in real-time.  These timetable changes 
 include:</p>
<p>• Adding classes to a student’s timetable</p>
<p>• Dropping classes from a student’s timetable</p>
<p>• Mass timetable changes to groups of students</p>
<p>• Editing the dates a student added or dropped a class</p>
<p>• Editing the start or end date for a continuous entry class</p>
<p>• Adding classes to a newly added student</p>
<p>• Withdrawing a student from school</p>
<p>• Any other function that may write to a student’s timetable</p>
<p>Editing student timetables (Quick reminders)</p>
<p>Individual classes are added and dropped from a student’s timetables 
 using:</p>
<p>Student’s record &gt; Class info &gt; Timetable &gt; Edit</p>
<p>The student’s class start and end dates may be edited, if required, 
 using:</p>
<p>Student’s record &gt; Class info &gt; Timetable &gt; Edit &gt; select 
 More icon (top right corner) &gt; Register</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Register provides a record of the dates the classes were last modified, 
 along with the class enrolment and end date (date the student started 
 and finished the class).  If the class has been removed from the 
 timetable, the drop date as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Row click a class in the register to edit the dates, if required. Only 
 dropped courses may be completely removed from the register (class will 
 be set to “Is deleted” in PASI so this should be really only used for 
 classes that were recorded in error where the student did not actually 
 attend).  Note:  Dropped classes are reported to PASI as “withdrawn”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dropping a future class from a student’s timetable will remove the class 
 record from the register automatically.  These classes are also set 
 to “Is deleted” in PASI.  </p>
<p>Student’s PASI course enrolments</p>
<p>You’ll find the Course enrolment menu option under the PASI submenu. 
  These is where you can see the student’s classes that are submitted 
 to PASI.</p>
<p>IMAGE OF MENU HERE</p>
<p>If a student has multiple school enrolments, first select the desired 
 school enrolment.  Multiple school enrolments occur when a student 
 returns to the school after a period of non-attendance (eg. student left 
 the school and came back).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>             </p>
<p>A Refresh icon is available in the Course enrolment card, if needed:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A collapsed card will appear for each of the student’s course enrolments. 
  The card title includes the Class (PASI code), status, and the start 
 and end date for the student’s enrolment in the course. </p>
<p>Course enrolment – PASI COMPARE tab</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the Show more icon to expand the card to show the PASI compare for 
 the class as shown here:</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>If the information in Maplewood and PASI were different, the Alert icon 
 will prominently appear as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you expand the card for a course, each discrepancy is highlighted 
 in yellow as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Push to PASI icon in the card’s tool bar is enabled and may be used 
 to manually attempt to send the Maplewood information to PASI.  If 
 it is successful, the alert icon is cleared and the Push to PASI icon 
 is disabled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course enrolment – fields </p>
<p>A course enrolment defines the student’s enrolment in a class section. 
 Data collected in this area includes:</p>
<p>• Record version: As part of the automatic PASI data exchange, version 
 numbers of automatically maintained for each PASI record type.   Version 
 numbers are automatically augmented each time the information is changed, 
 and a record with an higher version number cannot be updated with a lower 
 versioned record.</p>
<p>• Alberta Student Number (ASN): The student’s ASN.</p>
<p>• Deleted:  Yes will appear if a dropped class was completely removed 
 from the register (used on rare occasions such as removing a class that 
 may have been accidently added to the student’s timetable).  </p>
<p>• Course code: The PASI code of the class.  Only one course will 
 ever appear here for a student.</p>
<p>• Student enrolment ref id:  The unique code automatically created 
 by Maplewood that identifies the student’s school enrolment.</p>
<p>• Section ref id: The unique code automatically created by Maplewood 
 that identifies the class.</p>
<p>• Start date/End date: The dates the student started the class and the 
 last day the student attended the class (or is expected to attend). These 
 dates come from the ‘class enrolment date’ and ‘class enrolment end date’ 
 fields automatically recorded in the student’s register.  These dates 
 are based on today’s date and are automatically recorded as classes are 
 added or dropped, however they may be edited if required.  See Editing 
 student timetables (Quick reminders) on page 50.</p>
<p>• Course Enrolment Status: This is automatically determined by Maplewood 
 as follows:</p>
<p>Active:  the student is currently enrolled in the course.</p>
<p>Completed:  the student has finished the enrolment as anticipated.</p>
<p>Continuing: The student is continuing their study across course enrolments 
 and this course enrolment is expected to have a related successor course 
 enrolment. In Maplewood, this course enrolment status can be entered for 
 a course once it has been added to the student’s completed courses.  By 
 selecting this status, the mark information will be removed from PASI.</p>
<p>Incomplete:  The class is a CTS class (as indicated in the code 
 table) and the student has dropped the class without finishing the CTS 
 course material.</p>
<p>Registered:  The class has not yet started.  The overnight 
 synch will automatically change this status to Active on the entry date.</p>
<p>Withdrawn:  The class is not a CTS class and the student has dropped 
 the class (withdrew early from the enrolment after completing a portion 
 of the course).</p>
<p>• Credits Attempted:  The credit value of the class.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>• Instructional Minutes Received:  This field is optional, however, 
 if the school want to request funding for a dropped class, this field 
 must be populated (to help support the request for funding).  The 
 instructional minutes received may be entered in the register for dropped 
 classes only.  See Editing student timetables (Quick reminders) for 
 information on the register.  This field is also available when editing 
 a student’s completed courses.</p>
<p>• Dual Enrolment: When editing a student’s timetable, the dual enrolment 
 icon will appear beside any class that is flagged as dual enrolment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This setting may be turned on or off by row clicking the class to access 
 the dual enrolment option:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Selecting the Dual enrolment will present the form where the box may 
 be checked or uncheck:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• Funding Requested:  This will always be set to Yes, except for 
 one situation.  If a class is dropped, and no instructional minutes 
 are provided, the funding request will be set to No. </p>
<p>• Mark Format/Mark Value/Mark Assignment Date/Mark is Approved:  This 
 will automatically populated when the school runs the progress to ‘Add 
 completed courses’.</p>
<p>Course enrolment – ALERTS tab</p>
<p>If the student has Alerts for any of their course enrolments, the ALERTS 
 tab is enabled and will indicate the total number of alerts for the student’s 
 classes.  Alerts may include advice and/or warnings as shown here. 
  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Row click any of the alerts or advice to change the alert status as 
 shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course enrolment – REJECTIONS tab</p>
<p>If the student has Rejections for any of their course enrolments, the 
 REJECTIONS tab is enabled and will indicate the total number of rejections 
 for the student’s classes.  Rejections mean that the course enrolment 
 is not in PASI and these must be resolved. In this example, the student’s 
 school enrolment was rejected causing the course enrolment to be rejected 
 as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course enrolment – AUDIT HISTORY tab</p>
<p>The AUDIT HISTORY tab is available to see detailed information each 
 time the course enrolment was edited.</p>
<p>PASI Manager - Seeing all course enrolment alerts</p>
<p>In Maplewood, you can see all the alerts regarding course enrolments, 
 and discrepancies by following these steps from the division (central 
 office) or from the school:</p>
<p> Select the PASI statistics card from the dashboard OR</p>
<p> Select the PASI Manager option located in the Main menu </p>
<p>Once the PASI Manager has opened, select the ALERTS tab and choose Course 
 Enrolment from the Record Type filter.  By default, all alert types 
 will appear, but the list may be filtered to show only advice and/or rejection 
 and/or warning alert types.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Row click any alert to open a new browser window showing the PASI option 
 in the affected student’s record.</p>

 COURSE ENROLMENT</p>
<p>**** NOT IN MANUAL – NOT DONE YET *****Special notes about adding/dropping 
 classes</p>
<p>Continuous entry classes</p>
<p>Within Maplewood there is the feature to define Classes as continuous 
 entry, meaning that each student has a unique start and end date.  Please 
 note, this is different from PASI’s Continuing Course Enrolment Status. 
  Continuous entry classes in a student’s timetable have a unique 
 icon to clearly identify these classes, and when you select one of these 
 classes, the option Edit contin:</p>
<p>      </p>
<p>In Maplewood, when a continuous entry class is added to the student’s 
 timetable, today’s date is defaulted as the start date.  Select the 
 option Edit continuous entry class to access the student’s start and completion 
 dates since each student may start and finish the class at their own pace 
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the student completes a continuous entry, a completion date is 
 entered by the office or the teacher.  If the completion date is 
 entered by the office, they will receive a message similar to this (NOT 
 WORKING YET???):  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you opt to post a final mark to the Completed Courses (transcript), 
 the course enrolment status will be set to Completed (and the final mark 
 information will be sent to PASI).   </p>
<p>If the completion date is entered by the teacher, or the office does 
 not post the final mark at the prompted question, the mark information 
 will be added to the student’s completed courses when the office runs 
 the Achievement option called Add completed courses.  Mark information 
 will be sent automatically to PASI when the course is added to the student’s 
 completed courses (see Add completed Courses (PASI Marks) on page 62 for 
 additional information on this process. </p>
<p>Note:  Dropping a continuous entry class from a student’s timetable 
 will use today’s date as the completion date.  Dropped continuous 
 entry classes will also prompt to post a final mark to the student’s completed 
 courses.  If the class is dropped because the student is withdrawing 
 from the course, a final mark is not entered (*** SAY WHAT TO DO ON THE 
 FORM). The course enrolment status will be set to Withdrawn (if it is 
 not a CTS class) or Incomplete (if it is a CTS class).</p>
<p>Completing CTS classes</p>
<p>CTS classes often start and end and different times throughout the year 
 and are not necessary set up as continuous entry classes.  For this 
 reason, when you drop a CTS class from a student’s timetable, it will 
 provide the option to post a final mark to the student’s completed course 
 (just like Continuous entry classes described above).  NOT WORKING 
 YET</p>
<p>If you opt to post a final mark to the Completed Courses (transcript), 
 the course enrolment status will be set to Completed (and the final mark 
 information will be sent to PASI).  </p>
<p>If you do not post a final mark, the course enrolment status will be 
 set to Incomplete. </p>
<p>Dropping regular classes</p>
<p>Dropping a regular class (e.g. one that is neither CTS or continuous 
 entry) will be updated in PASI with the course enrolment status set to 
 Withdrawn.</p>
<p>Adding then dropping a class on the same date</p>
<p>If a class is added and dropped on the same date, the student’s course 
 enrolment will be set to ‘Is deleted’ in PASI.   These course 
 enrolments will not appear in the student’s PASI option for course enrolments 
 and they will no longer appear in PASI.</p>
<p>Dropping a future ‘registered’ class</p>
<p>If a student drops a class that has not yet started (course enrolment 
 status is Registered), the student’s course enrolment will be set to Deleted 
 in PASI.   These course enrolments will not appear in the student’s 
 PASI button and they will no longer appear in PASI.</p>
<p>Withdrawing a student</p>
<p>When a student’s leaves the school, the school will set the Maplewood 
 status to “Deleted”.  This will trigger all classes in the student’s 
 timetable to be dropped.  The following changes are sent to PASI:</p>
<p>• All current course enrolments will have the course enrolment status 
 changed from Active to Withdrawn (or Incomplete if CTS class).</p>
<p>• All future course enrolments (course enrolment status is Registered) 
 will be set to “Is deleted” in PASI. These course enrolments will not 
 appear in the student’s PASI button and they will no longer appear in 
 PASI.</p>

<p>Overview</p>
<p>The Completed courses  option within student records lists all 
 the courses a student has completed, along with official mark information. 
  Based on provincial requirements, both successful and unsuccessful 
 completed courses can be recorded here, as well as course withdrawals 
 required by some provinces. Although most schools only record courses 
 that the student took as part of their high school program, it can also 
 record courses that are non-credit courses, such as courses taken before 
 high school.</p>
<p>The completed courses area is also sometimes referred to as transcripts 
 or course history.   After final marks are recorded, the school 
 runs a process to automatically add the newly completed courses into this 
 area of the student’s record.</p>
<p>This section describes the process of how the office updates the students’ 
 completed courses area with newly completed courses, using the Add completed 
 courses tool.  This tool will add the course to a student’s completed 
 courses if all of these conditions are met:</p>
<p>• Course code exists in the Codes table</p>
<p>• Grade of course requires an official mark (based on the school setting 
 “Minimum grade of class requiring an official mark”)</p>
<p>• The official marks for the class are “Done” (based on Done check box 
 that teacher sets for the class) OR the student has a completion date 
 for the continuous entry class</p>
<p>• Official mark exists for the student</p>
<p>• The class end date (in classes table) is within the range of dates 
 the school specifies OR if the class is continuous entry,  the student’s 
 completion date is within the range</p>
<p>• The class (course) is not already added to the student’s completed 
 courses area</p>
<p>When a course is added, the mark is based on the mark provided by the 
 teacher, attendance is based on the student’s attendance recorded by the 
 office, and class attributes are based on the values in the classes table. 
  The student’s earned credit value will be set to 0.00 if the student 
 does not receive a passing mark.  </p>
<p>If a student repeats a course, the attempt with the lower mark will 
 have its credit value automatically changed to 0.  If the provincial 
 course codes use fewer than 7 characters, the number of characters to 
 check for duplicates is user-defined (e.g. MAT1A and MAT1A1 would represent 
 the same course if searching 5 characters).  </p>
<p>To access this tool, select the Menu icon in the left corner, then select 
 Student tools  or Achievement, then Completed courses. </p>
<p>    </p>
<p>This will take you to the Completed courses section where you will find 
 the Add completed courses card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select either the CHECK TEACHER to see whether teachers are finished 
 entering their official marks.  Select GO to add newly completed 
 courses.  Courses will not be re-added if the add courses process 
 is run multiple times.  </p>
<p>Before using this tool, it is important that teachers record the students’ 
 marks and indicates that they are done entering marks as explained here:</p>
<p>Teacher indicates official marks are done</p>
<p>When the teacher is finished entering the marks for all students in 
 the class, they will indicate that they are done recording the official 
 mark.  In the final report card term, the teacher will notice a blue 
 column for the official mark as shown below.  The teacher checks 
 the Done box when the official marks are ready.  If the Done box 
 is not checked, the marks will not be added to the student’s completed 
 courses even if marks are entered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note:  As part of a school’s setup for the teacher’s Maplewood 
 connectEd, there is a setting called “Minimum grade of class requiring 
 an official mark”.  This is typically set to grade 9 </p>
<p>(Ontario) or 10 (other provinces) but this setting may be adjusted to 
 fit each school’s needs .  Courses in grades lower than this setting 
 will not see the ‘Done’ box and therefore these courses will never be 
 automatically added to the student’s completed courses.  </p>
<p>The office may use the CHECK TEACHERS button to see whether the teachers 
 are done their official marks, and if needed, the office may check/uncheck 
 the Done box. </p>
<p>Check teacher </p>
<p>Use the CHECK TEACHER feature to generate a list of classes that are 
 completed within a date range to see whether or not the official marks 
 are done as shown here:</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>For each class in the list, the following information is presented:</p>
<p>Official mark done:  This is checked if the teacher has indicated 
 that they are done their official marks.   </p>
<p>• If the box is checked, the teacher cannot change the official marks. 
  </p>
<p>• If the box is unchecked, the class will be ignored when adding completed 
 courses. </p>
<p>The office may check/uncheck this box, however we would suggest that 
 this is only done in the following situations:</p>
<p>• The marks are done but the teacher forgot to check the done button 
 before leaving the school (e.g. summer holidays).</p>
<p>• The teacher accidently checked the done button and requested the office 
 to uncheck it.</p>
<p>Teacher:  The teacher(s) of the class.  </p>
<p>Class:  The class (course code and section letter) and title of 
 the class.</p>
<p>Class end date:  The end date of the class as recorded in the classes 
 table.</p>
<p>By default, the list will include all classes regardless of whether 
 the done box is checked or unchecked.  Select the tool bar icon to 
 change between:</p>
<p>   ‘List includes classes with official marks done’ and 
 </p>
<p>  ‘List excludes classes with official marks done’. </p>
<p>Note:  Continuous entry classes are automatically excluded from 
 the list.  These students have their own unique completion dates. 
 If the student’s completion date is within the range of dates considered 
 when adding newly completed courses, the course will be added using the 
 student’s completion date.</p>
<p>Suggested process for adding completed courses</p>
<p>At the end of each semester (or quarter if applicable), the following 
 steps are suggested for the school office:</p>
<p>1. Use the CHECK TEACHER option on the card to monitor whether the teachers 
 are done  their official marks.  The classes without a check 
 mark will be ignored, however you may still proceed with the next steps, 
 knowing that you will need to repeat all these steps when the official 
 marks are done for the ignored classes. </p>
<p>2. This step adds newly completed courses to the students’ completed 
 courses area of student records.  This step may be repeated multiple 
 times.  A course will not be duplicated if it was previously added. 
  If the course has already been added for a student, it will be ignored 
 completely, even if the teacher changed the mark, or this step is being 
 run with a different completion date.</p>
<p>From the Add completed courses card, select the GO button then fill 
 in the required information as explained below:</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Start date and End dates:  enter a date range (start and end date). 
  This range will be used to determine which classes to search to 
 see if official marks are done.  Classes with end dates in the range 
 will be considered, only if the teacher has indicated that the official 
 marks for the class are “Done”.  Note: Class end date is a field 
 in the setup of each class.  Students with continuous entry classes 
 where the student’s completion date is in this range, will also be considered.</p>
<p>Completion date:  Enter the completion date of the class.  This 
 is the date that will be recorded in the student’ record, regardless of 
 the actual class end date. Continuous entry classes, however, will use 
 the student’s completion date, not the date on this form.</p>
<p>(Alberta only) The field is called Completion date (PASI mark assignment 
 date):  This date can be today’s date or any date earlier in the 
 school year.  This date will be used as the Mark Assignment Date 
 in PASI, which may not be a future date.  </p>
<p>(Alberta only) Approve mark:  When the dates are set correctly, 
 check the Approve mark box.  This box must be checked before you 
 may access the ADD button on the bottom bar.  By checking this box, 
 the mark information will be submitted to PASI as approved .</p>
<p>3. Select the ADD button in the lower right corner. </p>
<p>(Alberta only) The ADD button is disabled if there is no check mark 
 in the ‘Approve mark’ box.  </p>
<p>4. A report will be generated of any students who were not updated because 
 marks were missing.  This should not be possible unless the ‘official 
 marks done’ was checked before marks were entered.  </p>
<p>5. Check a few students to see that the newly completed courses were 
 added using Student’s record &gt; Achievement &gt; Completed courses .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6. (Alberta only) Check a few students to see that the mark information 
 was submitted to PASI using Student’s record &gt; PASI &gt; Course enrolment 
 . </p>
<p>The following mark fields are submitted to PASI and will now appear 
 in the student’s PASI course enrolment record:</p>
<p>Mark Format:  Always set to Percent for course marks.</p>
<p>Mark Value:  The mark assigned by the school (teacher) from 0 to 
 100.</p>
<p>Mark Assignment Date: The date the mark was submitted to PASI.  Note: 
 the student’s course enrolment exit date must be within 30 days of the 
 mark assignment date.</p>
<p>Mark is Approved: This should always be Yes when marks exist.</p>
<p>Editing mark information for a completed course </p>
<p>If the mark information requires changes, you may edit the completed 
 course using Student’s record &gt; Achievement &gt; Completed courses 
 &gt; Click course to access Edit option.</p>
<p>Due to the real-time integration with PASI, the following changes apply 
 to Alberta provincially defined courses only:</p>
<p>• When editing a completed course, you must first un-check the box called 
 ‘Mark is approved’ (show below).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>• With the approved box unchecked, proceed with any changes and then 
 re-check the approved box to save the changes.  The new mark information 
 will be automatically submitted to PASI upon saving.</p>
<p>• M arks for provincially defined courses completed in previous years 
 may not be edited nor discarded. Non-provincially defined courses are 
 completely editable and may be discarded.</p>
<p>Removing all completed courses with the same completion date</p>
<p>If required, it is possible to remove all completed courses with the 
 same completion using Achievement &gt; Completed courses &gt; Remove  a 
 date.</p>
<p>Note: Provincially defined courses may not be removed from previous 
 years.</p>
<p>Searching for duplicate courses</p>
<p>If required, it is possible to search for courses that may be considered 
 duplicates, where the student is receiving credits for multiple attempts 
 of the same course, by selecting Achievement &gt; Completed course &gt; 
 Search for duplicate courses .</p>
<p>Calculate compulsory credits</p>
<p>Each course code entered into the ‘Completed courses’ (transcript) area 
 of a student’s record has an automatically calculated Y/N field that indicates 
 whether or not that course is compulsory (required to fulfill graduation 
 requirements). This calculation is done automatically every time a student’s 
 completed course is accessed, and it is done automatically as final marks 
 are posted to the completed courses area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There may be the occasional time where you may be asked to run the calculate 
 compulsory credits tool which will go through all current or past students 
 to recalculate the Y/N compulsory field. Typically, this is only run upon 
 the advice of Maplewood, however, there is no harm in running it at any 
 time using Achievement &gt; Completed course &gt; Calculate compulsory 
 credits .</p>
<p>Courses added directly to Completed Courses (PASI Evaluated marks)</p>
<p>Student’s record &gt; Achievement &gt; Completed courses</p>
<p>PASI also collects Evaluated Marks.  These are marks that are granted 
 to students outside of the enrolment of a class in the school (e.g. out 
 of province credits, challenge marks, etc.).  Evaluated Marks are 
 entered directly in the student’s completed courses area.  If the 
 course has an evaluation date during this school year, it will be automatically 
 submitted to PASI as an Evaluated Mark.</p>
<p>To add an evaluated mark for a student, select the Add icon in the Completed 
 courses tool bar:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the resulting form, select the course to be added.   If 
 the course is a provincially defined course, it will look like this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following information is entered for the evaluated mark:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Check the Mark is Approved box to enable the SAVE button in the lower 
 right corner:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When editing a previously entered evaluated mark, you must first un-check 
 the box called ‘Mark is approved’ (show below).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the approved box unchecked, proceed with any changes and then re-check 
 the approved box to save the changes.  The new mark information will 
 be automatically submitted to PASI upon saving.</p>
<p>Note:  marks for provincially defined courses completed in previous 
 years may not be edited. Non-provincially defined courses are completely 
 editable.</p>
<p>Student’s PASI evaluated marks </p>
<p>In Maplewood, you can see the student’s evaluated marks submitted to 
 PASI by selecting:</p>
<p>Student’s record &gt; PASI &gt; Evaluated marks</p>
<p>Evaluated marks – PASI COMPARE tab</p>
<p>Use the Show more icon to expand the evaluated mark card for a course:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Evaluated marks – fields</p>
<p>Data collected in the Evaluated Mark area includes:</p>
<p>• Course Code: The PASI code of the course in the transcript.</p>
<p>• Credits Attempted:  The credits attempted from the course in 
 the transcript.</p>
<p>• Evaluation Method:  The method recorded for the course (e.g. 
 MUS = Music Evaluation, OUT-BC = out of province: BC (similar codes for 
 other provinces/territories), PVT = Private School Evaluation, SCS = Special 
 Cases Evaluation, and WPC = Waived Prerequisite Credit).</p>
<p>• Evaluation Date:  The Date Completed field recorded for the course.</p>
<p>• Organization Code:  The school number of the school that entered 
 the evaluated mark.</p>
<p>• School Year: The school year (e.g. if 2017/2018 school year, it will 
 appear as 2018).</p>
<p>• Funding Requested:  Based on whether the funding check box is 
 checked in the transcript.</p>
<p>• Mark Format: PassFail or Percentage.  Percentage marks are allowed 
 for course challenge and music evaluation methods.  All other evaluated 
 marks are PassFail format.</p>
<p>• Mark Value:  The mark recorded for the course.  Note:  PASI 
 will only accept P for PassFail format marks.  If a P (Pass) was 
 entered in error, it may be changed to F (Fail) in PASI.</p>
<p>• Mark is Approved: This should always be checked in Maplewood.  If 
 it is not checked in PASI, the mark is not approved in PASI.  Submit 
 mark approval button can be used to synch this field.</p>
<p>Evaluated marks – ALERTS tab</p>
<p>If the student has Alerts for any of their evaluated marks, the ALERTS 
 tab is enabled and will indicate the total number of alerts for the student’s 
 evaluated courses.  Alerts may include advice and/or warnings as 
 shown here:</p>
<p>NEED EXAMPLE – NOT WORKING</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Row click any of the alerts or advice to change the alert status as 
 shown here:</p>
<p>NEED EXAMPLE</p>
<p>Evaluated marks – REJECTIONS tab</p>
<p>If the student has Rejections for any of their evaluated marks, the 
 REJECTIONS tab is enabled and will indicate the total number of rejections 
 for the student’s evaluated courses.  Rejections mean that the evaluated 
 mark is not in PASI and these must be resolved. In this example, ****** 
 clarify example???</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Evaluated marks – AUDIT HISTORY tab</p>
<p>The AUDIT HISTORY tab is available to see detailed information each 
 time the evaluated enrolment was edited (NOT READY YET).</p>
<p>PASI Manager – Seeing all Evaluated marks alerts &amp; approval status</p>
<p>In Maplewood, you can see all the alerts and discrepancies? regarding 
 evaluated marks by following these steps from the division (central office) 
 or from the school:</p>
<p> Select the PASI statistics card from the dashboard OR</p>
<p> Select the PASI Manager option located in the Main menu </p>
<p>Once the PASI Manager has opened, select the ALERTS tab and choose Evaluated 
 Marks from the Record Type filter.  By default, all alert types will 
 appear, but the list may be filter to show only advice and/or rejection 
 and/or warning alert types.</p>
<p>   Row click any alert to open a new browser window showing 
 the PASI option in the affected student’s record (may be working – can’t 
 tell until the ALERTS tab is working).</p>
<p>Marks</p>
<p>Course enrolment marks</p>
<p>Students registered in provincially defined courses at schools will 
 have those courses and marks reported to PASI through the course enrolment 
 record.  Each course enrolment includes these fields:</p>
<p>Mark format:  Indicates the format of the mark, such as letter, 
 numerical score, percentage, or pass/fail.</p>
<p>Mark value:  The mark value assigned to the student for the course. 
  Mark value may be a numeric value between 0 and 100 or A, B, C, 
 or P (pass) or F (fail).</p>
<p>Mark assignment date:  The date the mark was assigned as recorded 
 in the mark assignment date field in the completed courses area of the 
 student’s record.</p>
<p>Mark is approved:  A Y/N field to indicate whether PASI has approved 
 the mark.</p>
<p>Teachers are responsible for the entry of the student’s final mark (or 
 school mark prior to a diploma exam).  The school office runs a process 
 to add completed courses which takes the teachers’ marks and updates the 
 students’ completed courses area.  When the course is added to the 
 completed courses area, PASI is updated real-time with the new mark information 
 for the corresponding course enrolment.  Please see LINK TO ACHIEVEMENT 
 – COMPLETED COURSES – ADD COMPLETED COURSES. for information on this process.</p>
<p>Evaluated marks</p>
<p>Evaluated marks are course marks that are granted to students outside 
 of the enrolment of a class in the school (e.g. out of province credits, 
 challenge marks, etc.). Evaluated marks are entered directly in the student’s 
 completed courses area.  If the provincially defined course (grade 
 10 to 12) has an evaluation date during this school year, it will be automatically 
 submitted to PASI as an evaluated mark.  See LINK to http://www.maplewood.com/Maplewood%20connectEd%20for%20Schools/#t=Students%2Fpasi-student-evaluated-mks.htm 
 for more information.</p>
<p>Mark approvals</p>
<p>Marks must be approved by PASI in order for courses to be considered 
 part of the student’s official marks.  Even though the mark is sent 
 to PASI as approved, PASI must accept the approved mark.  Typically, 
 the school should monitor those marks that are not Approved by following 
 these steps from the division (central office) or from the school:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• Select the PASI statistics card from the dashboard OR</p>
<p>• Select the PASI Manager option located in the Main menu</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the PASI Manager has opened, select the MARK APPROVALS tab. By 
 default, all marks with issues will appear, while approved and deleted 
 marks will be excluded.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The list may be filtered to show specific approval statuses from this 
 list of possible statuses:  Update Required, Approval Required, Approval 
 Pending, Unapproval Required, Unapproval Pending, Approved, Deleted.  Remember 
 to select the filter button to refresh the results.</p>
<p>Use the expand icon to the left of the ASN to show more information. 
  The MARK DETAILS tab will show the Maplewood vs PASI values for 
 the mark information for the course enrolment (example 1 below) or evaluated 
 mark (example 2 below):</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the ALERTS tab to see details on alerts from PASI.  Alerts 
 may provide information as to why marks may not be approved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Clicking anywhere else on the record (except the expand/collapse icon) 
 to open a new browser window showing the PASI option in the affected student’s 
 record.</p>
<p>Use the RESUBMIT APPROVALS button on the bottom bar (to the left of 
 the CLOSE button) if you want to try to resubmit all marks with issues 
 for approval. </p>
<p>    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Official Marks (Marks Approved by PASI) </p>
<p>PASI has a process to approve a mark before it may appear as approved 
 in PASI.  PASI’s Official Marks include approved marks for Course 
 Enrolments and Evaluated Marks. </p>
<p>New students – Official marks automatically imported from PASI</p>
<p>When adding a new student into Maplewood, if the student exists in PASI, 
 the student’s completed courses area will be automatically populated with 
 the student’s Official Marks recorded in PASI. Please note that this data 
 in Maplewood is intended to provide users the ability to use course history 
 tools (such as scheduling, graduation lists, and course selection) effectively. 
  The official transcript resides in PASI.</p>
<p>History: Import from PASI</p>
<p>NOT THIS RELEASE -= OMIT FOR NOW</p>
<p>Student’s record &gt; Completed courses &gt; Import icon</p>
<p>With the Course Mark Integration, there exists the tool to import the 
 contents of a student’s Transcript into Maplewood.  Please note, 
 importing the data into Maplewood is intended to provide users the ability 
 to use Course History tools (such as scheduling, graduation lists, and 
 course selection) effectively.  The official Transcript resides in 
 PASI.</p>
<p>Upon pressing the Import icon, Maplewood will ‘go to PASI’ and pull 
 in the records into a temporary location for comparison.    The 
 top portion of the screen shows what is in the student’s Maplewood History 
 and the bottom shows the Records in PASI.  We match on the following 
 fields: PASI Code, Date, School Mark, Exam Mark and Final Mark.  Where 
 there are differences, the records will be highlighted.  </p>
<p>• Green indicates no matching course.</p>
<p>• Yellow indicates course matches but with a difference(s) in field(s). 
  </p>
<p>• Red indicates the course is in PASI, but the Maplewood Central Office 
 Code file does not contain that code.  </p>
<p>Maplewood will Update any of the following fields that differ within 
 Earned Credit, School Mark, Exam Mark and Final Mark on Courses Matched 
 with Differences.</p>
<p>A complete History/Transcript replace can be done by checking the Replace 
 Transcript box.  Please note, this will replace all 10-12, provincially 
 defined courses in the Maplewood History with the PASI Record.   This 
 is only recommended when a student has no history within Maplewood.</p>
<p>By default all records are checked, you may remove those which you do 
 not wish to update by removing the check mark from the update box.  After 
 selecting the PASI records to import, press the Update button.</p>
<p>You cannot Update (import) matching records (those which are white/not 
 highlighted).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Diploma Exam Marks </p>
<p>As diploma exam marks are available in PASI, the nightly synchronization 
 process will automatically update the student’s completed courses with 
 the exam mark and the final mark so that it matches the Official Marks 
 in PASI.</p>
<p>Detailed Academic Report (DAR)</p>
<p>The Detailed Academic Report, or DAR, is an unofficial document that 
 contains all high school course attempts, and official course marks and 
 credits awarded.  It is only provided to the student and the school’s 
 counsellors, and is not sent out by Alberta Education to post-secondary 
 institutions or other recipients.</p>
<p>Within the completed courses area of a student’s record, a DAR icon 
 will appear in the tool bar for students in grade 10 or higher.  Use 
 this icon to request the student’s DAR.  It will be downloaded as 
 a PDF file that may be opened to provide the same detailed academic report 
 that is available within PASI.  </p>
