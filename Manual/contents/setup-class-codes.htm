<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>Codes, courses and classes are closely related when a course is a provincially defined course and/or is to be recorded in the student’s “completed courses” area of their student record.  Only courses that are set up in the codes table may appear in the completed courses area. There are unique tables for codes, courses and classes. There is one shared table of codes in the board/division. Each school has 2 tables of courses and 2 tables of classes (one for this year and one for next year).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As schools build their course (subjects) tables to list the courses/subjects that they are teaching during the school year, they must use the official codes from the codes table if the course is to be recorded in the students’ completed courses (transcripts). From each course, the school creates unique classes (sections) for each time the course is taught. The classes must use the course from the courses table which is the course from the codes table. Therefore, the setup of the codes table will ensure that the schools will the official codes defined by the board/division.  If required, schools can also set up their own unofficial courses and classes. For more information See <a href="setup-class-courses.htm">courses</a> and <a href="setup-class-courses.htm#Classes">classes</a> for more information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This section of the manual will refer to the setup of the codes table. In school boards/divisions, the table of codes is maintained by the board/division. Each school can view the table of codes, however they may not edit anything.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note:  Private schools with only 1 school in the database will have full access to edit the codes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The setup area for codes is used in the following situations:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>The board/division needs to add new provincial codes that will be used in their schools.</li>
<li>The board/division needs to expire old codes that schools should no longer use.</li>
<li>The board/division needs to edit codes as needed.  Please read <a href="#Understanding_codes">Understanding codes</a> before proceeding with any edits.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 class="Blue"><a name="Understanding_codes" id="Understanding_codes"></a>Understanding codes</h2>
<p>The term ‘code’ in Maplewood connectEd will be used to refer to the official course code that the province or school board/division has determined will be used to represent a specific course curriculum. The term code will typically refer to the alphanumeric code used to describe the course, however there are 3 key fields that combine together to create a unique code. These are the 3 key fields:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>the code</li>
<li>course number (referred to as PASI code in AB)</li>
<li>grade level of the code  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Different provinces handle codes and course numbers differently. For example:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>Manitoba has provincial course numbers for every course (e.g. 117940S for grade 12 Western Civilization). A division may use 117940S for the code and course number, however, many find it easier to create a meaningful code such as HIS40S as long as the official course number contains 117940S or 1179-40S.<br/></li>
<li>All Nunavut schools use the codes defined and maintained by the province. An example code is SST2771 entered into both the code and number for grade 11 Social Studies 20-1.<br/></li>
<li>Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia have provincial course codes such as SST1771 for a specific grade 10 Social Studies curriculum (in AB) and AGR1010 for grade 10 Introduction to Agriculture (in SK) and PH 12 for grade 12 Physics (in BC). Using the SST1171 example, a division may use SST1771 for both the code and the course number (referred to as PASI code in AB). Alternately, a division can use a different code that better suits their needs (e.g. SOC10-1) as long as SST1771 is the course number.<br/></li>
<li>Ontario schools do not typically use course numbers. In those situations, the code will represent the official provincial course code (e.g. MCV4U is grade 12 Calculus and Vectors in Ontario) and the course number is left blank.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The table of codes lists all the codes that may be used on official high school transcripts, as recorded in the student’s “completed courses” area of their student record. Any other course recorded in any student’s completed courses must also exist in the codes table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The codes table will contain current, future, and past course codes. This is the main distinguishing difference between the codes and courses tables. Each school has a unique course table to list the courses the school offers this year, and another course table for next year’s courses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to the code/number/grade fields, each code has a title (English and French if required), credit value, language of instruction, and a number of other fields specific to your province. See <a href="#Code_fields">Code fields</a> for detailed information on all the fields for each code.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Board/division edits to the 3 key fields (code, number, or grade) will automatically change those values EVERYWHERE the code is used. This includes all students’ completed courses (transcripts), all schools’ courses and classes tables for this and next year. This is rarely required but provides an opportunity to correct mistakes in these fields.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Board/division edits to the other code fields (e.g. fields that are not the 3 key fields) will not impact any existing use of the code. It will impact future use only. For example, changing a credit value will only impact the credit value when a new class is created (credit values of existing classes will not change) and the default credit value is pulled from the code table. Changing the category field (used to determine if the course fulfils graduation requirements and for which area) will not change the category for those students that have already recorded the course in their completed courses (transcripts); however, the next students who have this course added to their completed courses will use the new category.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: In Alberta, PASI uses the term course subject rather than category.</p>

<p>The edit fields are the same as described in <a href="#Add_a_code">Add a code</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can navigate through the codes by using the PREVIOUS and NEXT buttons. Selecting any of the buttons at the bottom of the page will save edits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Board/division edits to the 3 key fields (code, number, or grade) will automatically change those values EVERYWHERE the code is used. This includes all students’ completed courses (transcripts), all schools’ courses and classes tables for this and next year. This is rarely required but provides an opportunity to correct mistakes in these fields.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Board/division edits to the other code fields (e.g. fields that are not the 3 key fields) will not impact any existing use of the code.  It will impact future use only. For example, changing a credit value will only impact the default credit value when a new class is created (credit values of existing classes will not change). Changing the category field (used to determine if the course fulfils graduation requirements) will not change the category for those students that have already recorded the course in their completed courses (transcripts), however, the next students who have this course added to their completed courses will use the new category.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>View code details</h2>

<h2><a name="Alberta" id="Alberta"></a><span style="color: #007fff;">Alberta</span></h2>
<p>Alberta Education has defined a list of official course codes for courses in grade 10 to 12 that may be used on official transcripts. The codes table will contain any codes that have or will appear on an official transcript for any student (even those who have attended in prior years).  The official course codes are recorded in the PASI code field, and the code may be the same as the official code, or another code that is more meaningful to the division/schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PASI  is an acronym for the Provincial Approach to Student Information, an Alberta specific initiative that provides a shared view of student data across the province. Data is shared between the PASI clients (school and school authorities) and the PASI core data in the provincial database. PASI collects information only for these official provincially defined codes. If a code is provincially defined, and the division has Course Mark Integration enabled, the codes from the PASI core database are automatically synchronized with the codes table in Maplewood. Therefore, code changes/edits are rarely required for grade 10 to 12 AB courses, and many fields are not editable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Alberta codes table has 2 tabs: Details and Prerequisites.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<h4>General:</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Code</span>: Alberta has provincial course codes such as SST1771 for a specific grade 10 Social Studies curriculum. Using the SST1171 example, a division may use SST1771 for both the code and the course number (referred to as PASI code in AB).  Alternately, a division can use a different code that better suits their needs (e.g. SOC10-1) as long as SST1771 is the course number.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">PASI code</span>: PASI code is the official course code defined by the province. PASI code is the term AB schools will see in place of course number, but both terms refer to the same field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Grade</span>: The grade level of the course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Credit value</span>: Indicates the credits of the course that would be applied to the student upon successful completion of the course.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Effective date</span>: The first date that schools may start using this code.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Expiration date</span>: The first date that schools may no longer use this code.</p>
<p> </p>

In addition to the values defined by PASI provided below, divisions may augment the list for defining their own graduation requirements that may vary from the provincial requirements (e.g. if division requires religion credits but the province doesn’t). Once PASI is enabled, this field is set by PASI if the code is provincially defined codes, but it may be augmented with division values if appropriate (e.g. religion code is set as Other by the province, but the division also sets it as Religion).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="../alberta/PASI_Code_Values.html#CourseCategory" target="_blank" id="a7"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #007fff;">Course category</span> <img src="assets/images/opennew.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:20px;" border="0"/></a>:  Assists students during course selection based on interest, credential program or special circumstances.

<p>This area is not editable because the data will come PASI once Course Mark Integration is enabled. Prior to that time, it will be set to No and greyed out. This data is irrelevant and not collected in the Course Mark file transmissions and it is for that reason it remains unavailable.</p>

<h3><a name="Prerequisites_tab" id="Prerequisites_tab"></a>Prerequisites tab</h3>
<p>Prerequisites define the courses that a student must have already successfully completed (or be in the process of taking) prior to taking the code. Prerequisite information is used when a student’s course selections for the next school year are entered and timetable edits are made. Students may not select courses that they have not yet fulfilled the requirements considering the student’s completed courses and courses that are expected to be completed by the end of the current year, as well as the other course selections the student has already requested. School staff may enter a course selection for a student who does not yet have the prerequisites, as they will be given a warning, but they may opt to continue with assigning the course to the student. Prerequisite information is also checked when classes are entered into a student’s timetable, and again, school staff may proceed past any warnings. Students and parents cannot overwrite the prerequisites.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Alberta, when PASI is enabled, the prerequisite information is populated automatically from the provincial PASI core database as part of the synchronization  process. Prerequisite information from the province is not editable, however the division may opt to add additional prerequisite information that applies to the students in their division. Prerequisites may also be added in each school’s course table, if needed. The school’s course table will automatically include the prerequisite information from the province, as well as prerequisite information from the division.  Schools may not remove or edit information that is automatically populated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While editing a course code, select the PREREQUISITES tab to see prerequisite information defined for the code as shown below:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/setup-codes10.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:598px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Each group (e.g. row) in the prerequisite GROUPS card contains at least one course that the student should complete prior to registering in the code.  Using the above example, before registering in 3C1400, the student should have successfully completed ASA34400 or CCS1910, and completed one of CCS2010 or CIN3145.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the Add icon to add a new  group.  If a group was added by the division, then the group may be edited as shown below, where new codes may be added to the group, or codes may be removed, or the entire group may be removed using the Discard icon on the toolbar.</p>
