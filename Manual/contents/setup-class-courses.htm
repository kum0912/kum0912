<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>Codes, courses and classes are closely related when a course is a provincially 
 defined course and/or is to be recorded in the student’s “completed courses” 
 area of their student record. The board/division is responsible for the 
 shared list of codes, and each school is responsible for maintaining their 
 school’s courses and classes. A course that a student takes to earn 
 credits toward their diploma must first be centrally defined as a code. 
 See <a href="setup-class-codes.htm#Code_fields">Code fields</a> for information 
 on codes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This section of the manual will refer to the setup of the courses table 
 at the school. The courses table is a list of courses (subjects) that 
 the school is teaching during the current school year, or plans to teach 
 next year. A course must exist in the courses table before the school 
 can create individual classes (sections/happenings) for each unique delivery 
 of the course to the students. See <a href="#Course_fields">Course 
 fields</a> for information on classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are 2 tables of courses: one for this year and one for next year. The 
 courses in the next year table represent the courses that students can 
 select when making their next year’s course selections, however sometimes 
 courses are also needed for timetable building purposes that are not available 
 to the students.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The setup area for courses is used in the following situations:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>The board/division has added a new course to the codes table and 
	 your school wants to start using the new course.  </li>
	<li>The school wants to add a new non-credit course for its own use. 
	  The new course will be worth 0 credits.  </li>
	<li>The school is no longer teaching a course and the course needs 
	 to be removed.</li>
	<li>The school wants to modify the course title defined by the board/division 
	 (in the code table). The school defined title is for school use 
	 only (course selections, timetables, class lists, etc). The official 
	 title will be saved in the completed courses area (transcript).</li>
	<li>School want to add or edit course fees.</li>
	<li>School wants to edit course information that is specific to this 
	 school. This information is detailed below, but includes information 
	 for timetable building such as weighting (for balancing course work 
	 loads between semesters), prerequisites, and sequencing with respect 
	 to other courses taken the same school year (e.g. course 1 and course 
	 2 must be scheduled in opposite semesters, or course 1 must be taught 
	 before course 2).</li>
	<li>Course descriptions (short and long) need to be entered/edited 
	 to assist students with online course selections.  </li>
	<li>The board/division needs to edit courses as needed. Please read 
	 Understanding courses  before proceeding with any edits.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Choose Setup &gt; Class info and select THIS YEAR or NEXT YEAR on the 
 Courses card.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses1.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:236px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The corresponding Courses page will appear.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="Courses" id="Courses"></a>Courses</h2>
<p>Here is an example of the courses table. It will be sorted in alphabetic 
 order (numbers first then letters).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses2.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:746px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the search icon to find a specific course, or use the page navigation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each course has a number of fields that may be set up, if required, 
 to meet the school’s specific needs. See <a href="#Course_fields">Course 
 fields</a> for more information.</p>
<h3><a name="Adding_a_new_course" id="Adding_a_new_course"></a>Adding a 
 new course</h3>
<p>Use the Add icon in the Courses tool bar to add a new course. Courses 
 are maintained by the board/district (Central office). The Add icon is 
 not available for schools. Schools have view only access.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then proceed to enter the new course details from the from the DETAILS 
 tab as shown here. See <a href="#Course_fields">Course fields</a> for 
 information on the fields located on the <a href="#DETAILS_tab">DETAILS 
 tab</a>.  Please see <a href="#SEQUENCED_COURSES_tab">Sequenced courses</a>, 
 and  <a href="#PREREQUISITES_tab">Prerequisites</a> for information 
 on the other tabs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses4.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:782px;" border="0"/></p>
<h3><a name="Editing_a_course" id="Editing_a_course"></a>Editing a course</h3>
<p>Select the course from the list to access the Edit option as shown below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses5.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:295px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then proceed to change the course information as needed. While editing 
 a course, it is possible to navigate to the next or previous course in 
 the list using the NEXT COURSE and PREVIOUS COURSE buttons at the bottom 
 of page. Selecting any of the buttons at the bottom of the page will save 
 any edits to the course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Board/division edits to the 3 key fields (course, number, or grade) 
 will automatically change those values EVERYWHERE the course is used. 
 This includes all students’ completed courses (transcripts), all schools’ 
 courses and classes tables for this and next year. This is rarely 
 required but provides an opportunity to correct mistakes in these fields.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Board/division edits to the other course fields (e.g. fields that are 
 not the 3 key fields) will not impact any existing use of the course. It 
 will impact future use only. For example, changing a credit value 
 will only impact the credit value when a new class is created (credit 
 values of existing classes will not change). Changing the category field 
 (used to determine if the course fulfils graduation requirements) will 
 not change the category for those students that have already recorded 
 the course in their completed courses (transcripts), however, the next 
 students who have this course added to their completed courses will use 
 the new category.</p>
<h5>Details</h5>
<p>Selecting a course from the list provides access to the Details option.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <img src="assets/images/courses6.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:252px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is an example:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses7.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:398px;" border="0"/></p>
<h5>Code details</h5>
<p>Selecting a board/division course code (e.g. course is maintained centrally 
 in the codes table) provides access to the Code details option.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses8.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:183px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This provides the user access to see the information recorded in the 
 codes table directly within the courses table. This is an example of code 
 details:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses9.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:394px;" border="0"/></p>
<h3><a name="Removing_a_course" id="Removing_a_course"></a>Removing a course</h3>
<p>A course may not be removed if any classes exist in the school’s classes 
 table for the appropriate school year (this or next). Next year’s 
 courses cannot be removed if the course has been entered in any student’s 
 course selections. If a course is to be removed, select the course from 
 the list to access the Edit option. From the edit course tool bar, select 
 the Discard icon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses10.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:556px;" border="0"/></p>
<h2><a name="Course_fields" id="Course_fields"></a>Course fields</h2>
<p>When a course is added or edited, the <a href="#DETAILS_tab">DETAILS 
 tab</a> is defaulted and this is typically the tab where any edits are 
 made. See <a href="#SEQUENCED_COURSES_tab">Sequenced courses</a>,  <a href="#PREREQUISITES_tab">Prerequisites</a>, and <a href="#REPORT_CARD_tab_">Report 
 card</a> for information on the other tabs.</p>
<h3><a name="DETAILS_tab" id="DETAILS_tab"></a>DETAILS tab</h3>
<p>The following fields are located on the DETAILS tab when editing a course:</p>
<h5>General</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Course defined in codes table</span>: 
 A field that must be checked if it is a credit course or any other course 
 that is to be saved as part of the student’s completed courses (transcript). 
  This is rarely changed once the course is added to the school’s 
 table. When adding a new course, it is important to understand the impact 
 of this field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the box is checked, then the course is selected from a drop down 
 list of codes maintained by the board/division.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses11.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:238px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the checkbox is not checked, then the course is created for the school’s 
 use by entering a course code, course number (PASI code in Alberta), and 
 the grade level of the course. These 3 fields must be unique to this school’s 
 courses table and the codes table. Credit value will be set to 0 and disabled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses12.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:508px;" border="0"/></p>
<h5>Course information</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Selection number (optional)</span>: 
 This is an optional feature, but may be useful if a school provides students 
 with a course listing that has a unique number assigned to each course 
 (e.g. ADA1A is selection number 1, ADA2A is number 2, etc). This 
 unique number is entered here. This allows the entry of a student’s course 
 selections to be done by entering this number rather than an alphanumeric 
 course code.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Display for student use during course 
 selection</span>: A checkbox indicates whether or not to allow students 
 to select this course when they are entering their own selections.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Is title same as code</span>: (Only 
 applicable if ‘Course defined in codes table’ is checked)  Indicate 
 yes if the title defined by the board/division in the codes table is to 
 be used.  Indicate no if the schools want to make a modification 
 to the title. Modifications are for school use only. The official 
 title will be stored when a course is stored in the student’s completed 
 courses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If this field is checked, then the Title English and Title French fields 
 are enabled for edits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Title English</span>: The title of 
 the course in English.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Title French</span>: The title of the 
 course in French, if required.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Short description</span>: A short description 
 of the course to help students when selecting next year’s courses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Long description</span>: A longer description 
 of the course  to help students when selecting next year’s courses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Department</span>: The department associated 
 with this course.  The table of departments is user-definable by 
 the board/division/school.  This field is optional and is for informational 
 purposes only.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><a name="Course_fees" id="Course_fees"></a>Course fees</h4>
<p>Each course in the school can be set up to charge course fees automatically 
 when adding to timetables by defining these 3 fields for the course:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fee</span>: If a student taking 
 this course is expected to pay a course fee, enter the dollar value of 
 the fee in the format ##.## (e.g. 12.50 for a $12.50 course fee).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">No refund after (days)</span>: If a 
 student has a course fee but then drops the course, the course fee will 
 be refunded unless there is a value entered here. If 10 were entered, 
 the student can drop the course and receive a refund for the first 9 normal 
 school days from the date the student started the class, however, on the 
 10 day or later, no refund would be applied. Fees and refunds are automatically 
 assigned to a student as classes are added and dropped from their timetable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fee type</span>: The fee type that 
 will appear in the student’s account when course fees are added and refunded. Fee 
 types are a board/division/district or school defined.</p>
<p style="color: #ff00ff;"> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="SEQUENCED_COURSES_tab" id="SEQUENCED_COURSES_tab"></a>SEQUENCED 
 COURSES tab</h3>
<p>This feature will be available in a later release.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When a student’s timetable can be automatically created by the application, 
 sometimes it is important to control the sequencing order of one course 
 with respect to another course.  Sequencing is only applicable to 
 secondary schools, where the school has more than 1 semester and/or term. 
 Typically sequencing refers to semestered courses, but it also works for 
 courses taught in single terms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A course may have multiple sequenced courses added. In the definitions 
 below, the course you are working on will be considered course A. The 
 course added to the SEQUENCED tab will be considered course B. For each 
 entry on the SEQUENCED COURSES, you select the course (course B) and the 
 type of sequencing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sequence 
 types</span>: These are the possible sequence types that will be considered 
 if both course A and B need to be scheduled into a student’s timetable:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternate</span>: 
 If course A has an alternate course B, courses A and B may not be taken 
 in the same semester. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: this 
 sequencing type will automatically appear on the SEQUENCED COURSES tab 
 for course B.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Blocked</span>: 
 If course A has a blocked course B, when the student is scheduled into 
 the class “a” section of course A, then the student will be scheduled 
 into the “a” class section of course B.  The students in the section 
 “a” class of course A and B are the same students, while the students 
 in section “b” of course A and B are the same students, and the “c” section 
 classes have the same students, etc. This feature is used when the schools 
 wants to keep students together for some classes during the day. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: this sequencing type will automatically 
 appear on the SEQUENCED COURSES tab for course B.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Co-sequenced</span>: 
 If course A has a co-sequenced course B, course B must be taken before 
 or during the same semester as course A. For example, chemistry might 
 have a co-sequenced math course so that the students have the math skills 
 required for the chemistry course.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pre-sequenced</span>: 
 If course A has a pre-sequenced course B, course B must be taken in semester 
 1 and course A must be taken in semester 2.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Teacher</span>: 
 If course A has a teacher sequenced course B, when the student is scheduled 
 into the course A, then the student is scheduled into course B taught 
 by the teacher of course A. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: this 
 sequencing type will automatically appear on the SEQUENCED COURSES tab 
 for course B.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>While editing a course, select the SEQUENCING tab to see the sequencing 
 information, as shown below:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses13.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:601px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the Add icon to add a new sequenced course or edit a sequenced course 
 by selecting its row. A sequenced course may be removed using the Discard 
 icon on the Edit toolbar as shown here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses14.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:333px;" border="0"/></p>
<h3><a name="PREREQUISITES_tab" id="PREREQUISITES_tab"></a>PREREQUISITES 
 tab</h3>
<p>Prerequisites define the courses that a student must have already successfully 
 completed prior to taking the course. Prerequisite information is used 
 when a student’s course selections for the next school year are entered. 
 Students may not select courses that they have not yet fulfilled the requirements 
 considering the student’s completed courses and courses that are expected 
 to be completed by the end of the current year, as well as the other course 
 selections the student has already requested. School staff may enter 
 a course selection for a student who does not yet have the prerequisites, 
 as they will be given a warning, but they may opt to continue with assigning 
 the course to the student. Prerequisite information is also checked 
 when classes are entered into a student’s timetable, and again, school 
 staff may proceed past any warnings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While editing a course, select the PREREQUISITES tab to see prerequisite 
 information defined for the course as shown below:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses15.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:542px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Each group (e.g. row) in the prerequisite GROUPS card contains at least 
 one course that the student should complete prior to registering in the 
 course. Using the above example, before registering in 3C1400, the student 
 should have successfully completed ASA34400 or CCS1910, and completed 
 one of CCS2010 or CIN3145.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use the Add icon to add a new  group, or select the row with the 
 group to Edit. Edit allows new courses to be added to the group, or courses 
 may be removed, or the entire group may be removed using the Discard icon 
 on the toolbar, as shown below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/courses16.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:386px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Note to Alberta schools: When PASI is enabled, 
 the prerequisite information is populated automatically from the provincial 
 PASI core database as part of the synchronization  process. Prerequisite 
 information from the province is not editable, however the division may 
 opt to add additional prerequisite information that applies to the students 
 in their division. Prerequisites may also be added in each school’s course 
 table, if needed. The school’s course table will automatically include 
 the prerequisite information from the province, as well as prerequisite 
 information from the division. Schools may not remove or edit information 
 that is automatically populated.</p>
