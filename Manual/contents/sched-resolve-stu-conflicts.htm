<h1>Scheduling next year &gt; Resolve student conflicts &gt; Students with 
 conflicts</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p></p>
 <p> </p>
<p>The Students with conflicts option provides a list of students who were 
 unable to get into all the courses they requested. Some schools may opt 
 to counsel students individually, and others may make changes to the timetable 
 based on the student’s alternate course selections (e.g. if the option 
 to substitute alternate courses for preferred courses was not used during 
 the load students process).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This option is used late in the scheduling process, specifically AFTER 
 the school has completed these 2 processes for the very last time:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>the classes are scheduled (the master timetable is complete) AND</li>
	<li>the load students process has been run for the last time.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To see students with conflicts choose Scheduling next year &gt; Resolve 
 student conflicts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-resolve-stu-with-conflicts-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:203px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select GO on the Students with conflicts card. The students with conflicts 
 option will list the students as shown here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-stu-conflicts-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:895px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will see the type of conflict for each student::</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Subjects not yet assigned 
 to periods (Courses not yet scheduled)</span>: The student has a preferred 
 course selection, but that course has no classes scheduled.  This 
 may appear when accessing this option before the school’s master timetable 
 is completed. If the timetable is still in progress, do not take the time 
 to resolve any student conflicts because running the load students process 
 may undo all your changes. Use the <a href="sched-unsched-classes.htm">Unscheduled 
 classes</a> option to see the list of courses that are not yet fully scheduled. 
  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #007fff; 
															 font-weight: bold;">C</span>onflict 
 (Multiple conflicts (no timetable))</span>: The student was not able to 
 get scheduled into 2 or more of their preferred course selections. The 
 timetable has been left empty so that the school can determine which classes 
 are best to include/exclude from the timetable. Select the student (row 
 click), to open a new browser window showing the edit of the student’s 
 next year’s timetable along with the courses that were not scheduled. 
 It will be similar to the example above, however every course will appear 
 as a course selection. Select a cell to schedule the student into a class 
 section (see edit timetable for more info).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Partially loaded (Single 
 conflict)</span>: The student was able to get scheduled into all but one 
 of their preferred course selections.  Select the student (row click), 
 to open a new browser window showing the edit of the student’s next year’s 
 timetable along with the course that was not scheduled. Here is an example, 
 showing only 1 unscheduled course selection with a cyan background colour 
 (as described in the legend):</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Important concepts when resolving conflicts:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Timetables may be altered after the year end roll over (e.g. after 
	 transfer to new year process is completed). If you plan to resolve 
	 the student conflicts after the roll over, you may want to export 
	 the list of students by selecting the export icon in the tool bar.<br/>
	</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 36px;"> <img src="assets/images/sched-resolve-stu-with-conflicts-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:594px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>When editing students’ timetables after the roll over (e.g. edit 
	 ‘this year’ timetable), it is still possible to show the student’s 
	 preferred course selections that are not yet in the student’s timetable 
	 by selecting the show/hide icon in the tool bar as shown here:<br/>
	<br/>
