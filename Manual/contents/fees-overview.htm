<p><span lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">Every school collects money (funds) 
 from students for various reasons. Funds include all forms of payment, 
 from cash to cheque to e-payments. How these funds are collected and recorded 
 may vary by school.  The Fees area is an excellent time saving feature 
 that allows schools to record financial transactions for both current 
 and past students. It has been designed as an Accounts Receivable for 
 student and beyond data entry there exist very powerful reporting features. 
 Schools are strongly encouraged to involve their financial resources during 
 the setup process. Additionally, it is important to plan ahead of time 
 just how the Accounts Receivable for students will best benefit the students, 
 school, division and community at large.<br/>
<br/>
It is recommended that a school Setup their Accounts area prior to Assigning 
 Fees and/or generating one of the many available Reports. Prior to the 
 getting into the setup, it is useful to become familiar with some of the 
 terminology that is used throughout the Accounts Area.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">P</span>rior 
 to the getting into the setup, it is useful to become familiar with some 
 of the terminology that is used throughout the Fees Area.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Transactions - Current vs Archives  </h2>
<p>Each time an entry is recorded in the fees area for a student, it is 
 recorded as a transaction. Transactions occur when a fee is added, a payment 
 or deposit is made, a refund is issued, or a payment is reversed due to 
 non-sufficient funds (NSF cheque). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are two distinct areas where transactions are stored. To distinguish 
 between these 2 areas, they are referred to as current and archives.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Current Transactions</h3>
<p>Current Transactions refers to any activity with respect to Accounts 
 for all Current Students. This does not include Past Students.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Archived Transactions</h3>
<p>In some instances, schools like to only see outstanding transactions 
 for students. For example, moving from year to year using the Archive 
 Utility a school may wish to move all zero balances to the archive table 
 of the database. Please note, partial payments will keep all tied transactions 
 in the Current Transactions table. The decision to Archive Transactions 
 or not is one that is dependent upon the school/board accounting policy. 
 With the exception of moving students to past (done at the end of the 
 year with the Transfer to New Year process), Maplewood does not automatically 
 Archive Transactions. An advantage to Archiving Transactions is a concise 
 display on the students’ accounts tab as well as increased performance 
 on the accounts database.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">A student’s transactions will remain as current, 
 until one of the following happens:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. The student’s status changes to Past. As part of the year-end process, 
 all students who are not returning to the school automatically become 
 past students and their fees are all moved to the archives. Any outstanding 
 fees may be paid or edited as required from the ARCHIVES tab in the student’s 
 fee function. The student’s Account Bill may also be printed from the 
 fees area of the student’s record.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. The school runs a tool that archives transactions prior to a specific 
 date. This process transfers the current transactions for all students 
 to the archives. Some schools run this tool at the end of each school 
 year, while others never run it.  This means that current transactions 
 may extend beyond the current year if the school does not run the archive 
 process. If a student has an outstanding fee (where the fee is not yet 
 fully paid), that fee will not be archived. As part of the archive 
 process, account bills may be automatically generated for those students 
 with outstanding balances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Some key concepts to understand:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>When looking at a student’s fees, you are looking at the student’s 
	 current transactions, unless you navigate to the ARCHIVES tab where 
	 you will find the archived transactions. You are looking at current 
	 transactions when you are on the SUMMARY , DEPOSITS SUMMARY, and TRANSACTIONS 
	 tabs.</li>
	<li>New fees can be added, and payments/refunds/voids can be made for 
	 both current and archived transactions.</li>
	<li>Past students can only have archived transactions. All other students 
	 may have current transactions and/or archived transactions.</li>
	<li>By following standard accounting practices, transactions can never 
	 be completely removed so that an audit trail exists.  Edits (adjustments 
	 in accounting terminology) that impact dollar amounts, will result 
	 in the addition of “A-“ before reference numbers (e.g. invoice number 
	 1234 will change to A-1234 if the fee amount is adjusted).</li>
	<li>The person who added a transaction is listed as the “Operator”. 
	  If the transaction amount is edited, the operator is replaced 
	 with the last person who modified the transaction. Technical note: 
	 The audit trail (in the database) actually records the operator for 
	 both the original and the edited transactions.</li>
</ul>
