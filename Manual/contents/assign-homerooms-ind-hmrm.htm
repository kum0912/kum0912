  <hr align="center" style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify;

  <p class="Style1">This tool provides a quick way to see the list of students in a homeroom, and allow each student’s homeroom to be edited. This is much faster than editing each student’s homeroom, one at a time.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A student has a homeroom for the current school year and the forthcoming school year, where applicable. Therefore, this tool is available for assigning this year’s or next year’s homerooms.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When a student’s current year’s homeroom is changed, a dated record of the change is stored in the student’s internal transfers. Internal transfers are accessible from the Internal transfers option within the Enrolment area of the student’s record. Along with the date of the change, it records the student’s original homeroom and their new homeroom.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>To access this tool choose Student tools &gt; Homerooms.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Select THIS YEAR or NEXT YEAR on the Individual by homeroom card, depending on whether homerooms are to be assigned to this year’s or next year’s homerooms.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-hmrm20.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 235px;" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The Homeroom - By individual homeroom screen will appear.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-hmrm21a.png" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:490px;" /></p>
  <p>First, select the grade from the drop down list. The students will appear in the Homeroom table, along with their currently assigned homeroom.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" src="assets/images/assign-hmrm21.png" style="border: none; width: 100%; max-width: 682px;" /></p>
  <p>To assign a different homeroom select the drop down and select a new homeroom.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As soon as a new homeroom is selected for a student, the new homeroom is saved for the student. The list of students will not be updated (so the student will still appear in the list even though they are no longer in that homeroom), however, when you close this application and then go back in, the list will be updated to show only the students in the selected homeroom.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Use the CLOSE button at the bottom of the page when you have finished assigning homerooms.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Depending upon your school’s report card setup, sometimes report card information is tied to the student’s homeroom. This information may include marks (such as overall student learning skills), comments (such as an overall comment on the student), and programs (such as IEP, ESL). If the report card information cannot be transferred because the original and the new homerooms are not setup the same way, a message will appear.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-style: italic;">We have detected a different report card setup between the original and the new homeroom for some students. If report card info could not be transferred to the new homeroom, it is still associated with the original homeroom and may be manually transferred if required.  Do you want to view their names?</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-style: italic;">                YES  NO</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p>
  <p>We would suggest you view the list of students, unless you know that teachers have not yet begun report card entries. If you examine the report card information for the students, you will be able to see the information for both the old (deleted) homeroom and the current homeroom. If required, transfer tools are available.</p>
