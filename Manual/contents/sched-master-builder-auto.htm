<h1>Scheduling next year &gt; Schedule classes &gt; Master builder - Automatic</h1>
<hr style="color: rgb(72, 82, 92); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; 
	 font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 13.3333px; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; 
	 widows: 1; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb;" align="center"/>
<p> </p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="sched-overview.htm">secondary scheduling overview</a> 
 for suggested steps to schedule the school. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Master builder- automatic will schedule classes into the best placement 
 (semester/term/day/period patterns) for each class, however it is limited 
 to the available locations where both the room and the teacher are available, 
 and any other constraints put on the class (e.g. class may be locked into 
 Semester 1). The best location for a class is determined by:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>the location with the fewest number of student conflicts  </li>
	<li>if there is a tie for fewest conflicts, the location with the lowest 
	 balance is selected.  Balance is the nominal number of students in 
	 that grade that will be scheduled into classes in that location (e.g. 
	 if 50 students requested a course with 2 classes, the nominal class 
	 size is 25 students per class).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Master builder – Automatic impacts the school’s master timetable only 
 (e.g. the set up of next year’s classes). The students in each class are 
 not updated until you run <a href="sched-load-students.htm">Load students</a>, 
 and therefore you cannot analyze conflicts arising from the new class 
 schedules until the load students process is done.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Depending on where you are in the scheduling process, first determine 
 which classes you want to have scheduled (e.g. all the grade 12 classes). 
  Then follow these steps for the group of classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>1. Choose Scheduling next year &gt; Scheduling classes.  </h3>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-auto-card.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:202px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Select GO on the Master builder - Automatic card to see this page:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-auto-main.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:974px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>2.  Set options</h4>
<p>Change these 2 options, if needed:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Number of passes</span>: It will default 
 3 passes, but may be set to any value from 1 to 5.  This controls 
 the number of times it will cycle through all the classes, attempting 
 to find a better placement for the class with each successive pass. If 
 there are 10 classes to be scheduled, and 3 passes, the application will 
 analyze class 1 to find the best location to schedule class 1 (class get 
 scheduled), then it will schedule class 2 then 3, then 4 … then 10, at 
 which point it has completed 1 full pass, and then it will repeat the 
 process again for pass 2.  Multiple passes allow the automatic scheduler 
 to re-evaluate the best location based on the adjustments to the other 
 classes in the previous pass.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff;">Periods per day a teacher can teach</span>: 
 It will default the number of periods in the school (e.g. if a school 
 is set up with 4 periods per day, it will default 4).  When determining 
 the best location to schedule a teacher, the automatic scheduler will 
 limit the teacher to the selected # of classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>3.  Specify the classes to be automatically scheduled</h4>
<p>Select the search method from the list of available methods.  Set 
 any other options, then refer to the hint text in the box.  Click 
 in the box, start typing the search text, and then press the Enter key. 
 The classes will be added to the card title ‘Classes to be scheduled’.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Text searches are not case specific (e.g. entering EN or en or En or 
 eN will all find the same results, in this example, the search is for 
 course codes or titles that start with en).  An asterisk in front 
 of the search text (e.g. *10) will be the equivalent to a ‘contains’ search 
 where the course code or title contains 10. Entering * is the equivalent 
 to an ‘all’ search. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">These are the search methods:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Course</span>: In the 
 box, type as much or as little of the course code or course title, then 
 press the Enter key. Optionally include only those matching courses with 
 a specific class section letter (e.g. change ‘Add class sections’ field 
 from ‘All’ to ‘a’ to include only classes with section letter ‘a’). Also, 
 if you want to include only those courses that have a specific # of class 
 sections, enter that number in the ‘# of sections’ field.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Class</span>: Typically 
 this method is used to add a specific class section (e.g. MAT10b), but 
 it will add all classes that match the entered text in the box.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Course grade</span>: 
 Select the grade from the ‘Filter’ field. Only grades applicable to the 
 school may be selected. Then enter the course code/title to be searched 
 in the box. Matching classes in that grade are added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Department</span>: 
  Select the department from the ‘Filter’ field.  Then enter 
 the course code/title to be searched in the box. Departments are user-defined. 
 Matching classes in that department are added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color: #007fff; font-weight: bold;">Teacher</span>:  Select 
 the teacher from the ‘Filter’ field. Then enter the course code/title 
 to be searched in the box.  Matching classes taught by that teacher 
 are added.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Regardless of the search method, matching classes will appear in the 
 card titled Classes to be scheduled:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mabu-classes.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:946px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scroll horizontally to see more info about each class, including the 
 delete icon to remove individual classes from the card. The delete icon 
 in the tool bar will remove all classes from the card.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>4. Select the SCHEDULE button</h4>
<p>From the bottom bar, select the SCHEDULE BUTTON.  This will submit 
 the scheduling job to the task queue. You may then select the CLOSE button 
 to leave and await notification that the task has been completed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/sched-mb-auto-buttons.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:701px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4>5. Continuing scheduling process when task is completed</h4>
<p>When you receive notification that the task is completed, and no warnings 
 are generated*, you have just finished step 1 for the group of classes. 
  Proceed to step 2, Assign students to classes – <a href="sched-load-students.htm">Load 
 students</a>, as illustrated here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/scheduling.jpg" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:568px;" border="0"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>* Sometimes, Master builder – automatic will generate a report indicated 
 that there were unscheduled classes.  These are classes that have 
 no available location in the timetable where both the room (or alternate 
 room) and teacher are available.  Use the <a href="sched-master-builder-manual.htm">Master 
 builder – manual</a> option on these classes to determine if there may 
 be changes to accommodate this class in the timetable.  This option 
 will quickly show what other classes are occupying the room(s) and teacher’s 
 time, or whether a constraint is limiting where the class may be scheduled. 
  Sometimes a different teacher or room may be needed, or a different 
 class needs to be rescheduled to free up a location for this class.  </p>
